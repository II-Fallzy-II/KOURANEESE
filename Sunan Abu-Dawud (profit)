Preface 17
Preface
Ijadith is next only to Qur'ân as a source of Islamic laws and proofs. The term
Hadith applies to the words and acts of Allah's Messenger as well as his
tacit approvals called Taqrir. The latter refers to acts done in his presence but
he did not disapprove of them, his silence indicating his approval. All these
three categories of A,adith are variously known as (1) Khabar, (2) Athar, (3)
Hadith and (4) Sunnah. (All these words have already been mentioned under
the technical terms employed by Ijadith scholars).
In contradistinction with Khabar and Athar, the words Hadith and Sunnah are
widely popular, so much so, that a mere mention of any of these two words,
inevitably brings to mind the words, acts and tacit approvals of Allah's
Messenger j. No other thought comes to our mind except the foregoing at
the mention of the word Hadith or Sunnah. Yes, of course, some people have
made a distinction between Hadith and Sunnah, advancing as argument the
words of some scholars, but, in fact, this distinction is not right. The Hadith
scholars make no distinction between the two. According to them, Hadith and
Sunnah are synonymous terms. Similarly, taking Sunnah as referring to the
Prophet's habits, modes of behavior and manners and thereby denying their
legal authority is equally wrong. It is, in fact, a deception, a concealed escape
route leading to the rejection of Aiadith. Again, in the same way, considering
only the acts of the Prophet that he did persistently and uninterruptedly as
binding is, in fact, a rejection of a vast number of Aiiãdith. Those who say so
have, in deed, allied themselves with the rejecters of Ahãdith. Moreover,
rejecting a Hadith on the ground that it is in conflict with Qur'an and
entraping people into believing so, is not the way befitting a Muslim. That is
the way of the crooked, the sectarians and the dissenters who reject a lot of
Ahadith on the seemingly attractive plea of being in disharmony with Qur'an.
Two centuries after the advent of Islam, the Mutazilites (Mu 'tazilah)111
rejected some Ahãdith. Their purpose was to justify their wrong and
misleading beliefs. Likewise, about a century and a half ago, the naturalists,
too, criticized the canonical authority of Ahãdith, their purpose being no more
than to affirm naturalism and reinterpret Qur'an according to their own
desires and whims. It is the same group of naturalists who, impressed in our
times by the 'rare research works' of the Orientalists and charmed by the
[1] A medieval theological sect that maintained that nothing but eternity could be asserted
regarding Allah, that the eternal nature of the Qur'ãn was questionable, and that
humans have free will.
Preface 18
wizards of the West and their civilization, are working in an organized way to
alienate the Muslims from their own culture and Islamic values and traditions
and are moulding them according to modern civilization.
Anyhow, the term Ijadith or Sunnah applies to whatever the Messenger of
Allah said, did, or gave his tacit consent to. This, like Qur'an, is an
independent, distinct and reliable source of faith and law (Shari'ah). To
benefit by Hadith and rely on it in giving legal rulings, we need to know the
following:
Things worthy to note
1. The faith revealed by Allah is Islam and only Islam. "Truly, the religion
with Allah (is) Islam." 11"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam,
it will never be accepted of him and he will be one of the losers in the
Hereafter." 21Allah commanded the believers to hold fast to the religion
and forbade them to divide and fall apart: "And hold fast, all of you
together, to the Rope of Allah, and be not divided among yourselves." 31
Allah also warned us through His Messenger : "And (He commands
you, saying): This is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other)
paths, for they will separate you away from His path. ,141
2. Since Qur'an has warned us, in several Verses, against separation and
disunion, which means only dissenting and dividing up into sects, and
since the Prophet has commanded us to follow one course only and
condemned other courses as wrong, it naturally follows, therefore, that the
True Path can only be one, not many. How can many paths be true at one
and the same Lime? It is not possible, neither by reason nor by tradition.
Qur'an declares: "After the Truth, what else can there be except
error? "151
3. What is this religion of Islam or the Straight Path? Where is it to be
found? It consists of two things: Qur'an and the 1-Iadith of the Prophet .
Allah's Messenger said: "I am leaving to you two things. You will not
go astray as long as you cling to them: the Book of Allah and the Sunnah
of His Prophet. ,[6]
4. This religion, unlike other religions, is not unguarded. It is secure from
tampering. Since this religion is final and the only way of deliverance for
mankind till the Judgment Day, Allah has undertaken the responsibility of
1' 1 ,41 'Imrãn 3:19.
[2] Al 'Imrãn 3:85.
[31 Al 'Imran 3:103.
[4] Al-An'am 6:153.
[51 Yunus 10:32.
[6] Muwattã' Imam Malik: 3.
Preface 19
guarding it. He said: "Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the
Reminder and surely We will guard it."111The intended meaning of the
Reminder is Qur'an that is guarded and made secure. It remained
unchanged and will remain ever so in future. Since it was impossible to
understand it and act by it without Afiadith, the safeguarding of it implies
the safeguarding of Hadith also. Therefore, in order to safeguard the
Ahadith, Allah created a group of Hadith scholars who took pains to
safeguard the Ahãdith, separating the genuine from the spurious. Hence,
Qur'an and Sunnah are the only two basic sources of religion. However,
to understand them correctly, the way of the Prophet's Companions and
the righteous predecessors is an indispensable aid.
5. None of the founders of the schools of Islamic jurisprudence ever claimed
that their ruling was final. On the contrary, they acknowledged they may
have erred and, hence, advised their followers to ignore their ruling in
case a sound, authentic Hadith is ever found contradicting their ruling.
Moreover, they are known to have recanted some of their opinions. In
case a Hadith was found later on contradicting the ruling of some jurist,
his students are reported to have declared that the Hadith in question had
remained unknown to their Imãm (the jurist) and that he would have
surely recanted his ruling if only he had known it. It should be noted that
Ahãdith were collected, recorded and examined long after the founders of
the schools had gone. For example, the Sound Six (Sihah Sittah) and other
books of Ahãdith were compiled later on. But, no doubt, those Imãms of
jurisprudence were excusable for their errors. Hopefully, they may be
rather rewarded because their intent was good. Anyhow, now that Ahãdith
have been collected and recorded, insistence on a particular legal ruling
and rejecting a Hadith on different pleas is quite unjustified.
6. The students of the Imãms of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) disagreed with
their own teachers and mentors on some issues, but none blamed or
rebuked them for having done so, but rather praised them for their truth
and scholarly ability. So it is no error or sin if today someone disagrees
with the learned Imams of Islamic jurisprudence. He deserves praise,
rather than condemnation.
Our Actions and Day of Accounting
We, too, are not exempt from what we have said earlier. Our instructions to
others are equally binding on us as on them. We call Allah as witness that we
have been fair in our evaluation of Ahadith. While deciding the soundness or
weakness of a Hadith, we never let ourselves be swayed by bias for any
particular sect, party or denomination or mental reservations, or preconceived
111 A1-Hijr 15:9.
Preface 20
notions or circumstances. We have been completely fair, just and honest in
our evaluation of Azadith. We have tried to be completely neutral. We have
kept our inquiries untainted with prejudice. Our research is purely scientific.
We followed only the accepted principles of Ijadith evaluation. Only then did
we decide a case or give a ruling as to which course is right or preferable.
Twisting or distorting a Ijadith, or wriggling out of it, or stretching it in an
attempt to arrive at far-fetched meanings, dubbing a Sound Ijadith as Weak
or a Weak one as Sound, declaring without proof a Hadith as abrogated or
abrogating - all these things we believe to be fraud, deception, and
concealment of truth. We seek Allah's refuge from these trickeries. Of course,
we may have erred in applying the principles of Ijadith evaluation, or we may
have erred for lack of access to information, or we may have misunderstood
something - and we will be grateful to those who point out our errors and
we pledge to correct them forthwith - but, by grace of Allah, we remained
honest and fair throughout our research work, there being no taint of bias for
or prejudice against any school of thought, or party, or sect, or denomination,
nor self motive or desire for profit. Allah is the Warden over what we say.

eastern Iran to south western Afghanistan.
The term As-Sijizi is also used as an ascription for SIstãn, hence sometimes
AbU Dãwud was called: "AbU Dãwtid As-SijzL" 41
He began to travel seeking Ahadith at a young age, and made his way to
Baghdad by the time he was eighteen years old. His journeys, seeking
knowledge, took him through the lands of Khurãsãn, Al-'Iraq, 'Arabia, AshSham, and Egypt.
His most famous teachers include Ahmad bin Hanbal, Isaq bin Ibrahim,
Yabya bin Win, Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Shaibah, his brother 'Uthman bin Abi
Shaibah, 'All bin Al-Madini, and 'Abdullah bin Maslamah Al-Qan'abi, who
was among those famous for reporting the Muw'atta' of Imam Malik.
His most famous students include his son, AbU Bakr 'Abdullãh bin Abi
Dawud, At-Tirmdhi, An-Nasã'i, AbU Bakr Al-Khalal, Ar-Ramahurmuzi, Ibn

Selected Statements About the Author and His Book E51
Al-Khattabi said: "The book of the Sunan, by AbU Dawud, is a noble book,
there has not been another book written in the knowledge of the religion that
References for his biograpy include Tarikh Baghdad, Tahdhlb Al-Kamal, Siyar A 'lam AnNubala', Al-Hãfiz AN Tahir As-Silafi's introduction to Ma 'ãlam As-Sunan by AlKhattabi, and Ghayat Al-Ma qsud ft Sharh Sunan AbI Dãwüd by A1-'Allãmah Al-'Aim
Abadi. All of what has been cited here is supported with authentic chains of narration.

biography.

is like it."
And he said: "I heard Ibn Al-'Arãbl say - while we were listening to him
(recite) this book; he pointed to the copy which was in front of him - 'If a
man does not have any knowledge with him, except that of the Mushaf in
which is Allah's Book, then this book, he would not have a need for any
knowledge at all beyond the two of them."
Al-Khattabi said: "AbU 'Umar Muhammad bin 'Abdul-Wãhid Az-Zãhid -
the companion of AbU A1-'Abbãs Ahmad bin Yahya - informed me, he said:
'Ibrãhlm Al-Harbi said: "When AbU Dawud wrote this book, Ahadith were
made supple for him, just as iron was made supple for Dãwud." Meaning the
Prophet Dãwud, peace be upon himJ1'
Al-Hãfiz Adh-Dhahabl said: "Along with his Imdmat in Hadith and its fields,
Abü Dãwud was among the major Fuqaha', for his book proves that. He was
among the distinguished companions of Imãm Ahmad; he attended his
lessons for a lengthy period of time, and he asked him about delicate issues,
in both branches (Furü') and fundamentals (Usül), and he stayed upon the
Madhhab of the Salaf, regarding following the Sunnah and submitting to it,
and not delving into problematic Kalam."2'
Those Who Narrate His Sunan
There are many who heard AbU Dãwud's Sunan from him, those that are
popular, or known to have reported it from him, are; Al-Lu'lu'! (Muhammad
bin Ahmad), Ibn Dasah, (AbU Bakr Muhammad bin Bakr bin Muhammad),
Ar-Ramli (AbU 'Elsa Ishaq bin MUsa), and Ibn Al-A'rãbl (AbU Sa'eed Ahmad
bin Muhammad). 131
His Books
Other than his Sunan, his letter to the people of Makkah, explaining the
conditions he adhered to in compiling his Sunan, and his Masa'il of Imãm
Ahmad, Abü Däwud is known to have authored the following: At-Tafarrud,
Al-Marãsil, A 'lam An-Nubuwwah, Az-Zuhd, and An-Nãsikh wal-Mansükh. Abü
'Ubaid Al-Ajurri compiled a book of questions that he asked Abü Dãwud,
11] These narrations and statements of Al-Khattäbi are taken from his introduction to
Ma'ãlam As-Sunan. The narrators in the chain for the last statement were all graded
trustworthy by A]-Baghdad! in TariTkh Baghdad, and each of them are confirmed to have
heard from the one he is reporting from. AbU 'Umar Az-Zahid was called "Tha'lab's
boy," and Tha'lab is Ahmad bin Yaya - Ash-Shaibäni of Al-KUfah - that Al-Khattäbi
mentioned.
121 Siyar A 'lam An-Nubalã', and by Kalam he means the philosophical theological issues
termed: 'Jim Ai-Kalãm.
131 The versions narrated by AI-Lu'lu'! and Ibn Dãsah are the most popular and most
complete. Occasionally, the reader will notice a footnote in the translation indicating a
variation based upon one of the versions, in addition, some comments of some of the
other reporters of the Sunan appear between square brackets.
Introduction 23
entitled: Suw'alãt Abi 'Ubaid A1-Ajjuri 'an Abi Dawud 11
Commentaries
The most famous of commentaries on the Sunan of AbU Däwud is that of AlKhattabi. He is AbU Sulaiman Hamd bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al-Khattäb
Al-KhaflãbI Al-BustI. He heard from the previously mentioned AbU Sa'eed Ibn
Al-A'rãbI in Makkah, and AbU Bakr Ibn Dasah in Al-Basrah, as well as other
scholars. 2' He died in the year 388 after Hijrah.
His commentary is on an abridged selection of chapters and narrations of the
Sunan, and it is said that his commentary is the first commentary on a Hadith
book, hence its great rank and importance in the field of Hadith commentary.
The name of his commentary is Ma 'alam As-Sunan.
There are many other commentaries written for the Sunan, some of them
published and others not yet published. Among them, that of Al-Mundhiri,
who compiled an abridgement of Sunan Abi Dawud with comments, Ibn
Qayyim A1-Jawzi, who compiled comments on an abridgment of the Sunan,
As-SuyUti, A]-'Ain!, and AbU Al-Hasan As-Sind!. An-NawawI, also compiled a
commentary which they say was not completed, and it is among those that are
lost.
The most famously cited commentary today, is that of Al-'Allämah AbU
Tayyib Muhammad Shams A1-IIaqq Al-'A?imãbãdi, entitled; 'Awn Al-Ma 'bud.
This work contains comments taken from his larger collection, entitled:
Ghãyat Al-Ma qsud, some of the larger collection is published.
His Objectives and Criteria
Regarding the level of narrators he included in his Sunan, AbU DawUd said:
"There are no abandoned (Matruk) Hadith narrators in the book of As-Sunan
which I wrote, and when there is a Munkar Hadith I clarified that it is
Munkar, and there is nothing other than it which is similar for that topic."
And the meaning of Munkar is an odd narration, whose narrators are
disparaged.
And, he mentioned about the weak Ahãdith in his book: "Whatever Hadith
there is in my book that has a severe weakness, then I have clarified it, and
whatever I did not mention anything about it, then it is Salih (good), and
some of them are more correct than others."13'
It is clear from its context, that some of the Ahadith not clarified by him are
[1] It is said that he authored other books as well. All of the above are mentioned by AlHãfiz Ibn Hajar, as books he heard with chains of narration to the author, in Al-Mu 'jam
Al-Mufahras also called: Tajrid Asdnid Al-Kutub Al-Mashhürah wal-Ajza 'al-Manthür.
[2] Al-Ansãb.
[3] These two statements are taken from AbU DãwUd's letter to the people of Makkah
regarding his Sunan, and most of its contents have been narrated from him through
various routes of transmission.

weak, while he did not consider them to be severely weak.
And he said: "I wrote, from Allah's Messenger , five-hundred thousand
Ahãdith, selecting from them what I included in this book - meaning the
book As-Sunan - so I collected four thousand Ahãdith in it,11' mentioning
what is Sahih, and what resembles that, and what is close to that." 21
Al-Hãfiz Tim Mandah said: "Aim Dãwud narrated weak chains of narration
when he did not find anything else for the topic, because that is stronger to
him then a man's opinion."13'
1' Our edition includes 5,274 narrations. It is possible that he made this statement at one
time, and included many other narrations later, since it is known that the various
editions narrated from him differ in the number of narrations, as well as the fact that
some of them contain chapters and books that others do not. It is also possible that in
this statement he means Ahadith with a complete chain of narration. In his letter to the
people of Makkah, he said: "Perhaps the number of Ahadith in my book reach four
thousand and eight hundred, and about six-hundred Ahadith that are Murial." And this
number is closer to what is known of it.

his introduction to Sahih Abi Dawud.

the people of Makkah, Abu Däwud also indicated that he cited Mursal narrations when
there was nothing similar for the topic.
Publisher's Foreword 25
Publisher's Foreword
All praise is due to Allah, Who honored His worshipers with the revelation of
His Mighty Book, which falsehood can not approach - neither in front of it,
nor behind it - being revealed by the All-Wise, the All-Praised, and He
honored them, by sending His Messenger, by whom success is granted to
whomever heard him, and witnessed him. Through him, , Allah opened the
eyes of the blind, and the ears of the deaf, and the hearts of the heedless, so
that everyone that feared Allah, and everyone that will achieve happiness in
the Hereafter, would believe in Him.
0 Allah! Send Salah, grant peace, and bless Muhammad, his family, and his
Companions who carried the banner of the Book and the Sunnah, and spread
Your mercy upon whomever follows them faithfully among your righteous
worshipers.
Indeed the Book of the Sunan by the noble Imãm AN Dawud, Sulaimän bin
Ash'ath bin Isaq bin Bashir bin Shaddãd, Al-Azdi, As-Sijistãni, who died in
the year 275H, is one of the Six Books, and the first of the Four Books,
among the most important of those books in which Hadiths are compiled.
There are many virtues and benefits to this book which resulted in the
scholars of Ijadith occupying themselves with the knowledge of Hadith since it
first became popular, causing it to spread around the world.
Indeed, Allah has honored Darussalam Publishers and Distributors in Riyadh
with service in the Book and the Sunnah, and Allah has honored us with the
publication of the translations of Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahth Muslim, Jämi' AtTirmidhi, Sunan An-Nasa 7, and Sunan Ibn Mãjah, and today, by the grace of
Allah, we present the translation of the Book of the Sunan of Imam AbU
Dawud, may Allah have mercy upon him.
After our previous publication of the each of the Six Books in the Arabic
language, we set out on the grand project of completing the translations of
the Six Books into the English language.
It is no secret to the avid reader, that most of the scholars agree that Sunan
AN Dãwüd is the best of the Four Sunan Books, being ranked as third in
importance behind Sahth Al-Bukhãri and Sahih Muslim. It is also well known
that some of the scholars have said that if a person has the Book of Allah,
and this Sunan of AbU DãwUd, then he has the fundamental texts of the
religion.
Such statements are a testament to the veracity of Imam AM DawUd, and his
compilation.
The Arabic text of Sunan Abü Dãwtid has been widely published in the
Publisher's Foreword 26
Islamic world, and a team of scholars has reviewed the famous publications
and manuscripts in verification of the text for our publication of the Arabic
text.
In verification of the Arabic text, we used the edition published along with the
commentary 'Awn al-Ma 'bud as the main source, while comparing it to that of
Al-Khattabi in Ma'alam As-Sunan, as well as a number of other valuable
printed editions of Sunan Abü Dãwüd.
There are some discrepancies of variation in some of the manuscripts and
reported versions, as well as published editions. Sometimes there is an
additional word here or there, or one Ijadith or chapter is cited earlier or
later in sequence.
In cases of additional words or phrases found in one or few of the
manuscripts and editions, the addition has been marked by square brackets
[]. This method is visible in the English translation as well, and whenever it
was deemed necessary to insert an explanatory term, then parenthesis ( ) were
used for that purpose.
For this English translation of Sunan Abü Dawüd, translating was done by
Yaser Qadhi (USA), and Nasiruddin al-Khattab (Canada) and editing by
Huda Khattab (Canada), finally reviewed by Abu Khaliyl (USA).
This publication represents the completion of our journey, which lasted for a
number of years, in the efforts to complete the translations of the Six Books,
and Allah praise is due to Allah.
Lastly, all of the Hadith in the text have been graded by the great research
scholar Hãfiz AbU Tãhir Zubair 'All Za'l.
We ask Allah to accept our good works in this endeavour, and to cause all of
the readers to attain the best benefit from it.

1. In villages or open spaces, to relieve oneself, one should go far enough, out of
the sight of people, to avoid being seen naked. In cities, however, where
toilets are enclosed on all sides, there is no need to go far away.

2. Such behavior on behalf of the Messenger of Allah () has a two-fold
advantage: It screens one's private area from being seen by others and, by
going away from dwellings, it keeps the living environment free of filth.
3. This and other similar Ahadith prove that the Messenger of Allah () had
many of the same needs as other human beings.

Appropriate Place To Urinate
3. Abu At-Tayydh reported that a
man informed him that when
'Abdullãh bin 'Abbas came to AlBasrah, he would narrate (Ahadfth)
on the authority of AbU Müsã. So
once he wrote to AbU MUsã, asking
him about certain matters. Abü
Musa replied: "One day I was with
the Messenger of Allah , and he
wished to urinate. So he went to a
soft ground beneath a wall and
urinated. He then said: 'If any
of you needs to urinate, let him
choose an appropriate place for his
urine." (Da'if)

Comments:
1. Extreme precaution should be taken in the matter of urine because it is
impure, and it is often not visible to the naked eye. It is necessary to keep
oneself away from it, and to wash it off on any contaminated garments in
order to keep oneself pure. One should look for a proper place to urinate to
prevent any of it splashing or returning upon oneself.
2. One should search for a soft surface of the ground to urinate, if that is not
available, one should look for sloping ground, for example, to prevent any of
it returning upon oneself.

Comments:
1. We learn from this Hadith that, wherever the toilet is, in a house or in
wilderness, one should say these words.
2. These words should be said prior to entering the toilet itself, because it is
improper to utter Allah's Name while relieving oneself, as well as while on
the toilet. In desolate places like a desert or forest, one should say these
words before removing whatever clothing is required to relieve oneself.
" All of this indicating the differences reported in the beginning of the narration.

It is the view of most scholars, that one should not enter the area in which he
intends to relieve himself while carrying something with Allah's Name on it.
His usage of the term Munkar here, as he explains, means that it is only reported
through this route, and he mentioned what is correct after it. The term Munkar is often
used to refer to a narration that is reported by a criticized narrator, which is
contradicted by more reliable narrators, either in its wording, or in its meaning, or if the
criticized narrator is the only one who reported it - as the author used it here.

He urinates as a woman urinates.'
The Prophet heard us, and said:
'Do you not know what happened
to a person of the Children of
Israel? They used to cut off any
part (of a garment) which urine
had splashed on. This person
prohibited them from it, so he was
punished in his grave." (Da'if)

Comments:
1. Not purifying oneself after urinating or not protecting oneself from it incurs
punishment in the grave.
2. Namimah or slanderous gossip is a major sin and, therefore, incurs
punishment in the grave.
3. It is implied that the Messenger of Allth placed the branches of the datepalm on the graves due to some Revelation. In a narration recorded by
Muslim (no. 7518) - Jäbir narrated about a similar incident - that the
Messenger of Allah said: "I passed by two graves (whose occupants) were
being tormented, and I wanted to intercede so that the torment would be
lessened for them, so long as these branches remain fresh.'

Comments:
1. The meaning of "bath area" is the actual location of performing Ghusl or the
like, meaning a tub, or shower, or bath house.
2. The Messenger of Allah forbade combing hair daily, with the intention to
discourage excessive attention to beautification and vanity. Some scholars
indicated that while this - in its apparent wording - applies to women as
(1] Al-Mustaham is from Hamim which is hot water, and the meaning is the bath-house or
the like, where hot water is used or produced for people to bathe in.

well as men, it is more stressed in the case of men, since beautification is less
restricted for women than men. Meaning, that it is more discouraged for men
to comb their hair every day than women.

1. It is forbidden to touch one's sexual organ (for males or females) with the
right right hand while relieving oneself. It may be inferred from this, that one
should also not touch that area with the right hand in general as well.
2. One should drink a beverage in three intervals, taking a breath in between.
(That makes three breaths). That is the Islamic manner of drinking any
beverage. 'Drink with one breath' means that one should breathe outside of
the vessel when drinking rather than inside of it.
32. Hafsah, the wife of the Prophet j LZL i U1. - ry

Comments:
The Hadith shows that the invocation by the Messenger of Allah () was
answered. Using the left hand to eat or drink is a major sin. The natural sense
of purity and cleanness dictates one should use one's right hand to eat or
drink. Using the left hand for this purpose is abominable because the left
hand is used to remove impurities after relieving oneself. Children should be
taught Islamic manners regarding cleanness and purity from an early age.
33. 'Aishah narrated: "The Prophet
would use his right hand for his
purification (Wudu'), and his
eating, and he would use his left
hand for (cleaning after) relieving

whatever he removes from between

Whoever comes to the toilet (AlGha'it), then let him conceal
himself, even if he cannot find
anything to do so except by
gathering a mound of sand and
sitting with his back toward it.
Indeed, Shaiãn plays with the

it will protect against the evil eye, or the like.

1. Charity given from unlawfuly earned wealth; via cheating, theft, robbery,
bribery, and extortion, etc., are not accepted by Allah.
2. Purification is a condition for the acceptance of Salat. In case water cannot be
used, Tayammum will substitute, as follows.
3. Ghulül means that which is treacherously acquired; and specifically it means
taking from the spoils of war before they are divided among the soldiers by
the leader.
Some of the manuscripts contain this narration, others do not. Some of them placed it
after number 50, others placed it here. We numbered it in the translation as it appears

about 210 liters of water.
2. "If the water is two Qullahs, then it will not become impure," means if filth
falls into that much water, the water does not become impure provided its
color, taste and smell have not been altered by the filth. If any filth is visible
to the eye, it should be removed, and the water may be used.
That is, as a statement of Ibn 'Umar, rather than the Prophet , while this version is
narrated by Hammad bin Salamah, and as a narration of Ibn 'Umar, attributed to the

having the urge to relieve oneself, and not leading a group of people in prayer
without their permission, are supported by other narrations, but the portion
prohibiting the Imam from supplicating for himself only, is not supported by
any authentic narrations, and there are many supplications reported from
Allah's Messenger jkr, in which he supplicated in the first person singular; see

Comments:
The foregoing Ahadith should not be taken as laying down rules for fixed
quantities of water. The purpose is to encourage and exhort, in that this is
enough water, while more is used when needed. Water should be consumed
as sparingly as possible. Undue use or waste is not permissible.
See the explanation of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal cited in the text.

advisable to spray one's garment, below the navel (around the area of the

The word 'night" occurs in the previous Aãdith. That's because one's hands
are more likely to get polluted at nighttime rather than the day. However, the
ruling applies to all times, night or day. If one sleeps during the daytime, one
should still wash one's hands after awaking, prior to submerging them into the
vessel holding water for purification.

added advantage of driving away devilish insinuations arising from constant
fear of urine dripping out due to a weak bladder.

'(Of these factors) is touching the

Comments:
The Ahadith listed below (no. 182, 183) appear to be at variance with each
other. The order to perform Wu1ü for touching the genitals applies to males
and females, since some versions of it specify that. Many scholars reconciled
between the order, and the apparent allowance, saying that the allowance is
for the case when there is a barrier between the hand and the private parts, as
would occur during prayer or the like. But when there is no barrier, and one
touches it with the hand, then the order is to perform Wudu' prior to praying.

told him: "Come back (away from

hands in between the skin and
flesh, then inserted it until it
disappeared up to his arm-pit. He
then proceeded onwards, and lead
the people in prayer without
performing Wuiü'. (Sahih)
'Amr (one of the narrators) added
in his narration: "Meaning he did

Dhat Ar-Riqa' - a person among

he (the idolater) swore that he
would not rest until he had spilled
some blood of the Companions of
Muhammad . He followed the
tracks of the Prophet (tracking
the caravan) until the Prophet .
encamped at a certain location. He
(the Prophet ) asked: 'Who will
stand guard for us (for the night)?'
A person from among the
Muhajirin and a person among the
Ansãr both volunteered. The
Prophet told them: 'Stand
(guard) at the entrance of the
valley.' When the two men reached
the entrance, the Muhajir laid
down on his side, and the Ansari
stood up in prayer. The man (i.e.,
the idolater) came and saw his
figure (from afar), and realized
that he was the lookout of the
people. So he shot him with an
arrow and hit him. He (the Ansari)
pulled it out (and this happened)
until he shot him with three arrows.
The Ansari went into Rukü' (the
bowing position) and SujiTid (the
prostration position), until his
companion (the Muhajir) noticed
what had occurred. When the
idolater realized that they had
discovered him, he fled. The
Muhajir, seeing the bleeding that
had occurred to the Ansarf, asked
him: 'Subi'zan Allah! Why did you
not inform me the first time he
shot (the arrow)?' He replied: 'I
was reading a Sarah, and did not
wish to interrupt (its recitation).'

Comments:
1. The author stated: "It was reported by Ibn Abi 'ArUbah from Qatãdah with
another wording." That is narrated by the author, from Ahmad, in his Masa 'ii
from him. And its wording contains: "Among them were those who
performed Wudü' and among them were those that did not peform Wuiü'." It
was also recorded by Al-Bazzãr and AN Ya'la, and its meaning is similar to
number 201, which is also recorded by Muslim (no. 836). That is: some of
them slept, so some of them performed Wudü', and some of them did not
sleep, so they did not perform Wudü'.
2. The 'Ishã' prayer is a distinguishing mark of the Muslim Ummah. Unlike
other prayers, it is recommended (Mustahab) to perform it later during the
night, provided it is not difficult on those attending that congregation.
3. There is no harm if there is an interval of time between the Iqamah and the
opening Takbir when there is a need for it, and there is no need to call the
Iqamah again in such case.
202. It was narrated from Abü
Khãlid Ad-Dalani, from Qatadah,
from Abü Al-'Aliyah, from Ibn
'Abbãs, that the Messenger of
Allah jW, would prostrate and sleep
and snore, then stand up to pray
without performing Wuçtü'. I asked
The Book of Purification 134
him: "You have prayed without
performing Wuiu', even though
you fell asleep." He said: 'Wuçlu' is
only necessary for the one who
slept while lying down." 'Uthmän
(one of the narrators) added: "...for
if he lies down, his joints will
loosen up." (Da'rf)
AbU Dãwud said: The phrase:
"Wusiti is only necessary for the
one who slept while lying down" is
a Munkar I-Iadith. 11 It was only
narrated by Yazid AN Khalid AdDilãni, from Qatadah. A group of
narrators narrated the first portion
(of this incident) from Ibn 'Abbas,
and did not mention any of this
(meaning, Ibn 'Abbas asking the
Prophet and his reply).
He said: "The Prophet was
protected. " 21And 'Aishah said
that the Prophetsaid: "My eyes
sleep but my heart does not." And
Shu'bah said: "Qatadah heard only
four Hadiths from AbU Al-'Aliyah:
The Hadith of Y(inus bin Matta, 131
and the Hadtth of Ibn 'Umar
regarding the prayer, and the
Hadith: 'There are three types of
judges, '141and the Hadith of Ibn

them from touching the ground)."

AbU Dawud said: I mentioned this

Ahmad bin Hanbal. He censured
me by way of rejecting this

2. The contents of the Hadith are supported by other Ahadith. If a man walks
over dirt and filth but, later, walks on thy earth until the filth wears off, his
body and garments will become pure.
3. It is not permissible to gather one's hair or garments while praying. They
should be left as they are. Their shape or form should not be changed/altered

copulation did not end in ejaculation. 'Water is only (necessary) for water"

water of ejaculation. This ruling was abrogated by Azadith that say: "When
the circumcised part touches the circumcised part, Ghusl has become
obligatory."

If one remembers he is in a state of major impurity, or such occurs to him
while in the Masjid, (as, for example, due to a nocturnal emission), one should

as is erroneously believed by some.

asked about) a person who
remembered having a wet-dream
but did not find any wetness. He

237. It was reported from YUnus,
from Ibn Shihãb (Az-Zuhri), he
said: " 'Urwah (reported) from
'Aishah, that Umm Sulaim AlAnsariyyah, the mother of Anas bin
Mãlik, asked: '0 Messenger of
Allah! Indeed Allah is not shy of
the truth. Tell me, if a woman sees
in her sleep what a man sees,
should she perform Ghusl or not?'
The Prophet ç said: 'Yes, she
must perform Ghusl if she found
(traces of) wetness." 'Aishah said:
"I turned to her and said: 'Uff to
you! And does a woman see such a
matter?' So the Messenger of Allah
turned to me and said: 'May

Abu Dawud said: This is how it was
reported by Az-Zubaidi, Mãlik, and
the paternal nephew of Az-Zuhri
from Az-Zuhri; as well as Ibn AN
Al-WazIr, from Malik, from AzZuhri. Musãfi' Al-Hajabi was in

Umm Salamah's statement "Indeed Allah is not shy of the truth'

Chapter 96. The Amount Of
Water With Which Ghusl Can
Be Performed
238. It was reported from Malik,
from Ibn Shihab (Az-Zuhri), from
'Urwah, from 'Aishah; that the
Messenger of Allah would
perform Ghusl for Janabah from a
container which contained a Faraq
of water. (Sahih)
AbU Dãwud said: Ma'mar said in
this kiadith (which he reported)
from Az-Zuhri: "She said: 'I would
perform Ghusl with the Messenger
of Allah Q5, from a container which
contained a Faraq of water."
AbU Dawud said: I heard Ahmad
bin Hanbal say that a Faraq is
sixteen RatlsJ" And I heard him
say that the Sã42' of Ibn Abi Dhi'b
was five and one third Rails. So I
asked him (his opinion about)
those who say it is eight Ra fls, and
he replied: "This has not been

And I heard Ahmad bin Hanbal
say: "Whoever gives for the
Sadaqat Al-Fitr, five and one third
Rails using this Rati of ours, then
he has given enough." He was
asked: "A-aiiani 21 is very
heavy!" So he said, "As-Saihãni is
better?" He said: "I don't know."

Comments:
This quantity of water, according to some Ahadith, was used by the Messenger
of Allah and, according to other Ahadith, used by both the Messenger of
Allah , and 'Aishah, and, according to still others, the Messenger of Allah
used to peform Ghusl with one Sã' or one and a quarter ã' of water.
These different Ai'zadith are easy to reconcile since they refer to different
situations.

did not mention the private part
explicitly - "then he would

Then he would put both his hands
in the container, and pass them
through his hair, until, when he

The blood flow of an adult woman during her menstrual cycle is called menses,
indicative of absence of a pregnancy. Excessive, abnormal flow of blood is called
Istihddah (menorrhagia, commonly known as "bleeding"). The color of this blood is
different from that of normal menstrual blood. Blood following childbirth is called Nifãs.
The days of menstruation (Haid) and post-partum bleeding (Nifas) are counted as days
of impurity. But the days of excessive, abnormal bleeding (Istihãdah) are days of purity
because that is an ailment.

Ghusl For Every Prayer
288. 'Amr bin Al-Ilarith reported
from Ibn Shihäb, from 'Urwah bin
Az-Zubair and 'Amrah bint
'Abdur-Rahman, from 'Aishah the
wife of the Prophet , who said:
"Umm Habibah - the sister-in-law
of the Messenger of Allah and
wife of 'Abdur-Rahmãn bin 'Awf
- suffered from Istihadah for
seven years. She asked the
Messenger of Allah about that
so he replied: 'This is not
menstruation, rather it is (from) a
vein, so perform Ghusl and pray."
'Aishah said: "So she would
perform Ghusl in a tub, in the
room of her sister Zainab bint
Jahsh, until the redness of the
blood would discolor the water."
(Sahih)
289. It was reported from YUnus,

She Should Combine Between
Two Prayers, And Perform One

294. It was reported from Shu'bah,
from 'Abdur-Rahmãn bin AlQasim, from his father, from
'Aishah who said: "A woman
suffered from Istiddah during the
life-time of the Messenger of Allah
. So she was commanded to
advance the 'Asr prayer, and delay
Zuhr, and perform Ghusl for both
of them, and to delay Maghrib and

Ghusl for the $ubi prayer."

The woman mentioned in the narration is Sahlah hint Suhail as stated in the
next narration. This Ghusl is recommended, but performing Ghusl once is
enough, as it has been mentioned in the narration of the next chapter. This
narration also shows that if the person is ill or suffering from some ailment,
then it is allowed to join two prayers together. Two prayers like Zuhr and 'Asr
can be offered together, and similarly Maghrib and 'Ishã' can be offered
together.
295. It was reported from
Muhammad bin Isaq, from
'Abdur-Rahmn bin Al-Qasim,
from his father, from 'Aishah, who
said: "Sahlah bint Suhail suffered
from IstihãIah, so she came to the
Prophet Al, and he commanded
her to perform Ghusl for every
prayer. When that became difficult
for her, he commanded her to
combine between Zuhr and 'Asr
(prayers) with one Ghusl, and
between Maghrib and 'Is/ia' with
one Ghusl, and to perform Ghusl
for Subh." (Da'J)
AbU Dãwud said: Ibn 'Uyaynah
reported it from 'Abdur-Rahman

does not pray.' So the Messenger
of Allah said: 'Sub/ian Allah!
This (Istihadah) is from Shaitãn.
She should sit in a tub, until she
sees the yellow (discharge) above

perform one Ghusl for Zuhr and
Asr, and one Ghusl for Maghrib
and 'Is/ia', and perform one Ghusl

Wudü' in between these (two
prayers)." (Da 'if)
AbU Dawud said: Mujähid reported
it from Ibn 'Abbäs that when
performing Ghusl becomes difficult
for her, he commanded her to
combine between the two prayersJ11
AbU Dawud said: Ibrãhim reported

This is the popular view; peforming Ghusl for every two prayers is
commendable, otherwise performing Ghusl at the end of menstruation is

Abü Dwud said: The Hadith of
'Ad! bin Thãbit, A1-A'mash from
Habib, and AyyUb AM Al-'Alã', all
of them are weak, they are not
correct. What proves the weakness
of this narration of Al-A'mash
from Habib is that Hafs bin
Ghiyath narrated it from AlA'mash in a Mawquf form, and
Hafs bin Ghiyath rejected the idea
that the narration of Habib was
Marfi'. Asbt also reported it from
A1-A'mash in Mawqaf form from
'Aishah.
AbU Dãwud said: Ibn Dãwud
reported it from Al-A'mash, in a
Marfu' form in the beginning of it,
and he rejected that it contained
the mention of Wudü' for every
prayer.
What proves the weakness of this
narration of Habib is the report of
Az-Zuhri from 'Urwah from
'Aishah, that she said: "So she
would perform Ghusl for every
prayer" in the Ha&th about the
one who suffers from Istihadah.

And Hishäm bin 'Urwah reported
from his father that the woman

All of these Ahadith are weak
except the narration of Qamir, the

319. (There is another chain of
narration) similar to this (i.e., no.
318) Hadith, it stated: "The
Muslims stood up, and hit their
hands on the sand, but did not take
any dirt (in their fists)." The rest of
the Ijadith is the same, but in this
version (wiping) the elbows and
armpits are not mentioned; Ibn AlLaith (one narrator) added:
"...until above the elbows." (Sahih)
320. Ibn 'Abbas narrated from
'Ammar bin Yasir that the
Messenger of Allah spent the
night at (a place called) Uwlat AlJaish, and 'Aishah was with him.
An onyx necklace of hers from (the
city) of Zifar broke (and was lost),
-

so the people were held back
searching for that necklace of hers.
(The time for) Fajr came upon the
people, and they did not had any
water with them. At this, Abü
Bakr, may Allah be pleased with
him, became angry at her, and said:
"You have held the people back,
and they do not have any water!"
So Allah, the Most High in His
remembrance, revealed to the
Messenger of Allah the
concession of purifying themselves
with pure earth. The Muslims
stood up with the Messenger of
Allah , and struck the ground
with their hands. They then lifted
up their hands without taking any
sand in it, and wiped their faces
and hands until their shoulders,
and (wiped) with the inside of their
hands until the armpits.
In his narration, Ibn Yaya (one of
the narrators) said: "In his
narration, Ibn Shihãb said: 'People
do not take this (Hadith)." (Sahih)
AbU Dawud said: Similar was
reported from Ibn Isbaq, he said in
it: "From Ibn 'Abbãs." And he
mentioned (striking the ground)
two times just as was mentioned by
Yunus. Ma'mar reported it from
Az-Zuhri: "Two times." And Malik
said: "From Az-Zuhri, from
'Ubaidullah bin 'Abdullah, from his
father, from 'Ammar."
And AbU Uwais said similarly:
"From 'Ubaidullãh, from his
father, or, from 'Ubaidullãh, from
Ibn 'Abbas" - one time he said:
"From his father" and one time he
said: "From Ibn 'Abbas." Ibn

Comments:
1. This is among the proofs that demonstrate that there may be cases where a
Muslim has to excersise his or her own judgment until verifying what is
appropriate.
2. Based upon what is authentic of the narrations regarding Tayammum, one
pats the two hands on clean earth, and rubs the dust on their face and hands.
Tayammum suffices whenever one cannot find water for major and minor
purification.
321. Shaqiq narrated: "I was sitting
with 'Abdullãh (bin Mas'Ud) and
AbU Müsã (Al-Ash'ari). AbU Müsã
said: '0 AbU 'Abdur-Rahmãn! Tell
me, if a person became sexually
impure, and did not find water for
an (entire) month, would he not
perform the Tayammum?' He said:
'No, even if he did not find any
water for an (entire) month!' AbU
MUsã said: 'Then what will you do
with this Verse in Sürat Al-Ma 'idah:
Then if you do not find water,
perform Tayammum with pure
earth? [21 'Abdullãh replied: 'If this
concession were to be given to
them, it is possible that if the water

Meaning that it was narrated differently by him on different occasions and sometimes he
mentioned Az-Zuhri in it while other times he did not, and such conflict in the narration

MUsä said to him: 'And you have
disliked this (meaning,
Tayammum) only due to that

it)?' He said: 'Yes.' So Abo MUsä
said to him: 'Did you not hear what
'Ammar said to 'Umar: "The
Messenger of Allah sent me for
some errand, and I became sexually
impure. I did not find any water, so
I rolled over in the earth just like
an animal rolls over. I then
returned to the Messenger of Allah
, and mentioned this to him. He
said: 'It was sufficient for you to do
like this,' then he hit his hand on
the earth, wiped it, then wiped his
left hand over his right hand, and
his right hand over his left hand,
with the palms, and then wiped his
face.' So 'Abdullãh responded (to
AbU MUsa): 'And do you not see
that 'Umar was not satisfied with
'Ammar's saying?" (Sazih)

don't have enough water for

me, I would not pray until I find
water.' Then 'Ammar said to him:

So as for me, I rubbed myself (with
dust). When we returned to the
Prophet and mentioned this to
him, he said: "It was sufficient for
you to do like this," and he hit
both his hands on the earth, blew
upon them, and wiped his face and
hands up to half of his forearms.'
'Umar said to him: '0 Ammar!
Fear Allah.' He said: '0

you so desire, then by Allah I will
never mention this again.' So
'Umar said: 'No, by Allah, we will

told 'Ammär: "0 'Ammar! It is

Comments:
In this Hadith is proof that the person who fears for himself, due to the
extreme cold, that using water will be dangerous for him, then he is allowed
to perform Tayammum. Similarly, it proves that the one who has performed
Tayammum may lead those who peformed Wudü' in prayer.

the freed-slave of 'Amr bin Al-'As,

incident (as in no. 334), and said,
"So he washed his private areas, and
performed the Wuiu' of prayer. He
then led them in prayer..." and the
rest of the narration is the same.
And he did not mention the

by a rock, so his head was (inflicted
with a) wound. He then had a wetdream. He asked his companions:
'Do you think that I have a
concession to perform
Tayammum?' They said: 'We don't
think that you are allowed this
concession while you are capable of
using water.' So he performed
Ghusl, and (due to it) died. When
we returned to the Prophet 4Li, he
was informed of what occurred. He
said: 'They killed him, may Allah
kill them! Why did they not ask if
they did not know? Verily, the cure
to ignorance is asking! It would
have been sufficient for him to
perform Tayammum, and to drop
(some water on his head), or to tie

Comments:
"The wounded person..." In our edition, the term is: "A1-Majdür" and it
means afflicted with small pox. Ad-Daraquni, Al-Bazzar, Ibn Khuzaimah, AlHakim, and Al-Baihaqi recorded a narration from Ibn 'Abbãs, in which he
commented on Allah's saying: "But if you are ill or on a journey" (Al-Ma 'idah
5:6) - saying: "When a man has wounds suffered in the cause of Allah, or
ulcerated lesions, or small pox, and he becomes sexually impure, and he fears
death if he peforms Ghusl, then he may perform Tayammum." The chain of
narration is weak, see number 272 of Sahih Ibn Khizaimah. Perhaps the
The Book of Purification 217 %4I
author intended to infer what is mentioned in that narration of Ibn 'Abbãs,
since he narrated a different version from him in this chapter. In some other
editions, the chapter is entitled as "Al-Majrüh," meaning 'wounded" as we
have translated it here, and most of the Sunan books have a chapter with
Majrüh rather than Majdür.

There is a difference of opinion about the precise interpretation of this
sentence. See nos. 349 and 350. It has been translated according to one of the
more general interpretations, and Allah knows best. After no. 496, AtTirmidhi said: 'Regarding this Hadith, MahmUd (one of the narrators) said:
Waki' said: Whoever performs Ghusl' refers to him; 'and bathes completely
refers to his wife.' It has been reported that ['Abdullah] bin Al-Mubarak said
about this Hadith: "Whoever bathes completely' and "Whoever performs
Ghusl' means washes his head and performs Ghusl. Ibn Al-Mubãrak is one of
the narrators in no, 1087 of Ibn Majah, as well as this narration (345) of AbU
DawUd, while it is Waki' in no. 496 of At-Tirmidhi. These two views reported
by At-Tirinidhi are the most popular. In Tuhfat Al-A hwadhi, Al-Mubãrakpuri
preferred the second view, that of Ibn Al-Mubärak, while in his notes on Ibn
Majah, As-Sind! quoted As-Suyciti's view, which elaborated on the first view,
that of Waki'. Most of them say that Goes early, arriving early' means at the
early time for the prayer, and early for the Khubah.

From Aws Ath-Thaqafi, from the
Messenger of Allah that he
said: "Whoever washes (Ghassala)
his head and Ightasal (performs

the same (as no. 345). (Sahih)
347. 'Abdullãh bin 'Amr bin A1-'As

Comments:
Even though it is correct that they attended the Friday prayer, those who
come after the Khaib begins the Khutbah will have less of a reward.
According to similar and more detailed versions of this Hadith, the Angels
close their records after the Imãm appears to start the Khutbah (see. No. 1986
of Sahih Muslim). It should be noted that the example of an egg is given here
only to explain the reward that one gets for offering a camel, a cow, etc. It
does not mean that an egg can be offered as a sacrifice.

353. 'Ikrimah reported that a
group of people came to Ibn
'Abbas from Al-'Iraq. They said:
"0 Ibn 'Abbas, do you think that
Ghusl on Friday is obligatory?" He
replied: "No, but it is purer and
better for the one who performs
Ghusl. And whoever does not
perform Ghusl, then it is not
obligatory for him. And I will
inform you how (this) Ghusl
started. People used to work hard;
they would wear wool garments,
and work with their backs
(meaning, manual labor). And their
Masjid was small, with a low roof,
made out of palm-leaves. One day,
the Messenger of Allah came
out on a hot day, and people were
sweating in their wool garments,
until the stench from them harmed
(disturbed and distracted) others.
When the Messenger of Allah 44
smelt this odor, he said: '0 people!
When this day arrives, then
perform Ghusl, and let everyone of
you apply the best oil and

fragrance that he has." Then Ibn
'Abbas said: "After this, Allah, ff"-' J.
Exalted is His remembrance,
blessed (the Muslims) with much
good, and so they wore other than
wool, and did not have to work
(themselves), and their Masjid was
expanded. So the matter which
used to trouble them, of (the
stench) from their sweat, was
removed." (Hasan)

Comments:
These narrations are proof for the majority, those who say that Ghusl for the
Friday prayer is recommended, and more virtuous, but not absolutely
obligatory. In the explanation of Ibn 'Abbas, the causes of the order to
perform Ghusl are explained in detail, making it the most complete and
comprehensive means of Fiqh (understanding) of this topic, and harmonizing
all of the narrations related to it. Since he said: "I will inform you how (this)
Ghusl started..." and, that on this occasion, Allah's Messenger W-", said: "0
people! When this day arrives, then perform Ghusl..." So Ibn 'Abbãs is one of
those who reported the order to perform Ghusl on Friday. Scholars consider
the explanation of the circumstances surrounding a Ijadith, as they consider
the explanation of the circumstances of the revelation of a Verse of the
Qur'ãn - as well as the interpretation of a Companion who narrated the
Hadith - among the safest means of attaining Fiqh from the text.
354. Samurah reported that the
Messenger of Allah said:
"Whoever performs Wu*iü' on
Friday, then that is sufficient and
acceptable, and whoever performs
Ghusl then that is more virtuous."

Comments:
A person who accepts Islam should perform Ghusl. After accepting Islam,
dress and hair style which resembles the disbelievers should be removed. It is
not allowed to imitate the dress and hair style of the disbelievers. The
scholars have explained that the meaning of "the hair of disbelief refers to a
hair style indicative of a disbeliever. Circumcision is one of the signs of Islam
and the Prophet ordered circumcision. Circumcision is an obligation upon
males after accepting Islam. - -

She did not always have to wash the garment because it did not have

saliva of a menstruating woman is not impure.
358. 'Aishah said: "We would only
have one garment, in which we
would menstruate. If some blood
fell on it, we would moisten (the

2. THE BOOK OF
AS-SALAT (THE PRAYER)
Performing the five daily prayers, or Salat, is the most important obligatory
deed after uttering the two testimonies of faith, and abandoning Salat is a
form of disbelief.
Chapter 1. The Obligation To
Perform The Salat (Prayers)
391. It was reported from AbU
Suhail bin Malik from his father,
that he heard Talhah bin
'Ubaidullãh saying: "A person from
the people of Najd came to the
Messenger Allah ; whose hair
was dishevelled, and the sound of
his voice could be heard, but (we)
could not understand what he was
saying until he came close (to the
Prophet ji). Then he began to ask
about Islam. The Messenger of
Allah said: 'There are five
prayers in a day and night.' He
said: 'Is there any that are
obligatory upon me besides these?'
He said: 'No, unless you wish to do
so voluntarily.' And the Messenger
of Allah ç mentioned the fast of
Ramadan to him, so he asked: 'Is
there any that is obligatory upon
me besides it?' He said: 'No, unless
you wish to do so voluntarily.' And
the Messenger of Allah also
mentioned the charity to him.111
[1] Meaning, the obligatory Zakat.

He said: 'Is there any that is
obligatory upon me besides this?'
He said: 'No, unless you wish to do
so voluntarily.' So the man turned
away (to leave) and said: 'I swear
by Allah I will not do more than
this, nor less!' The Messenger of
Allah then said: 'He has
succeeded, if he is truthful."

[1] The phrase: "by his father," is a form of an oath that was common among the Arabs.
Scholars differ in explanation of it here, since the Prophet j himself prohibited
swearing or giving an oath by other than Allah. Others stated that the Prophet said
so before the prohibition to swear by other than Allah was revealed. Another
interpretation is that this phrase might outwardly appear to be an oath, but is not
actually considered one due to its frequent use by the Arabs (in other words, the custom
of the Arabs was not to use this phrase as an oath, even though linguistically it appears
to be an oath), or that its meaning is: "by the Lord of his father" and this was to be
understood, but later it was prohibited. A few scholars were reported to have said that
this phrase was added by one of the narrators. Whatever the correct interpretation is of
this phrase, scholars agree that it is not permissible to give an oath or swear by any of
the creatures.

Chapter 2. The Times Of
As-Salãt
393. Ibn 'Abbas reported that the
Messenger of Allah said: "Jibril
- peace be upon him - led me in
prayer at the House111twice. So he
prayed Zuhr with me when the sun
had passed its zenith and (the
shadow) was the length of a sandal
strap. 2' And he prayed 'Ayr with
me when the shadow was
equivalent in length (to an object).
And he prayed - meaning Maghrib
- with me at the time that a
person breaks his fast. And he
prayed 'Is/ia' with me when the
redness of the sky disappeared.
And he prayed Fair with me at the
time that eating and drinking
become prohibited on a fasting
person. On the next day, he prayed
Zuhr with me when the shadow was
equivalent in length (to an object).
And he prayed 'Asr with me when
the shadow (of an object) was
equivalent to twice its length. And
he prayed Maghrib with me when
the fasting person breaks his fast.
And he prayed 'Ishã' with me after
a third of the night (had passed).
And he prayed Fajr with me, and
the light was apparent (around us).
Then he turned to face me, and
said: '0 Muhammad! These are the
times (of prayers) of the Prophets
before you, and the time is
[1] Meaning, at the Ka'bah in Makkah.
[2] "The length of a sandal strap" describes the shadow's apperance in Makkah once it was
noticable that the sun had passed the zenith. It is not necessarily the same in every

Comments:
This, and the following narrations show the beginning and end of the time for
obligatory Salat, and that the Salat is valid any time between the beginning
and the end. Other narrations prove that performing Salat during the earlier
portion of its valid time is recommended, with the exception of 'Ishã' wherein
it may be better to delay it to a later time within its valid time, see Ahãdith
nos. 397, 398 and 420.
394. It was reported from Usãmah
bin Zaid Al-Laithi that Ibn Shihãb - -
,- narrated that 'Umar bin 'Abdul-
'AzIz was sitting on the Minbar,
and he delayed 'Asr slightly.
'Urwah bin Az-Zubair said to him: '4 1r' >U Li Lc1 L.c1 3t5
"Verily, Jibril - peace be UpOfl :I Ui
him — has informed Muhammad - - - - -
of the times of the prayers."
'Umar said: "Be careful of what - .. ... - - . -, L . j J uj you say!"
'Urwah said: "I heard Bashir bin :-~l Le I,, ).
AN Mas'Ud say, that he heard AbU

A person would leave (after) the

Maghrib when the sun set. And he
would pray 'Ishã' when the skies
would become dark, and sometimes
he would delay it until the people
congregated. And he prayed $ubiz
(Fajr) once while it was (still) dark,
and another time he prayed it while
it was bright. Then after that he
would pray it while it was dark, and
he did this until he died, never
returning (to the time) of
brightness." (Ijasan)
Abü Dawud said: This Hadith was
reported from Az-Zuhri by
Ma'mar, Malik, Ibn 'Uyaynah,
Shu'aib bin AbI Hamzah, Al-Laith
bin Sa'd, and others, and they did
not mention the time he prayed in
it, nor its explanation.
It was reported like that by Hisham
bin 'Urwah and Habib bin Abi
MarzUq, from 'Urwah similar to
the narration of Ma'mar and his
companions, except that Habib did
not mention Bashlr in it.
Wahb bin Kaisan reported from
Jabir, from the Prophet
regarding the time of Maghrib: "He
said: 'Then he came for Maghrib
when the sun disappeared,'
meaning the second day - 'at the
same time." 11
Abü Dãwud said: And that is how
it was related from AbU Hurairah,
" See At-Tirpnidhi no. 150 and An-Nasã'i no. 527.

not respond to him until he
ordered Bilal to call for Fajr at the

a person could not recognize the
face of his companion, or when a
person could not recognize who
was next to him. Then he ordered
Biläl to call for Zuhr when the sun
was at its zenith — when a person
would say: 'Is it the middle of the
day?' and he would know. Then he
commanded Bilãl to call for 'Asr
while the sun was bright and high
(in the sky). Then he commanded
Bilãl to call for Maghrib when the
sun disappeared. And he
commanded Bilãl to call for 'Ishã'
when the twilight disappeared.
On the next day, he prayed Fajr
and (when) he left we asked: 'Has

Based upon these, and similar narrations, it is considered recommended by
most of the scholars that the 'Ishã' prayer be offered at a later time within its
valid time, provided that it is not a burden upon the people, as indicated in

This version of the narration has the word Asbihü, while other versions (see

"Asfiru". At-Tirmidhi mentioned the different interpretations. He ended with:

becomes illuminated such that there is no doubt in it.' They did not hold the
view that the meaning of Al-Isfar is to delay the prayer. Meaning, the
majority of the scholars consider it to mean to pray the prayer when it is clear
that it is Subh or the dawn of morning, that is, not too early.
Chapter 9. Preserving The
Prayer Times
425. It was reported from
'Abdullãh bin As-Sunabihi that he
said: "Abu Muhammad presumes
that the Witr is obligatory." So
'Ubãdah bin As-Samit responded:
"Abü Muhammad is mistaken. I
testify that I heard the Messenger
of Allah say: 'Five prayers,
Allah, the Exalted and Sublime,
has made obligatory; whoever
performs their Wudi7' well, and
prays them well at their proper
times, and completes their Rukü'
and their humility, he has a
promise with Allah that he be
forgiven. And whoever does not do
so, has no promise with Allah. If
He wants, He will forgive him, and
if He wants, He will punish him."

The 'AbU Muhammad' mentioned in this narration was a Companion of the
Prophet among the Ansar; scholars have differed regarding his name. It is
said his name was Mas'Ud bin Aws bin Yazid, and it is said it is Mas'Ud bin
Zaid, and other than that. Al-Khattabi said: "Ubãdah was only rejecting the
idea that Wits was obligatory like the Fari obligation, like the five prayers, he
was not rejecting that it was an obligatory Sunnah." Meaning, Allah's
Messenger performed Wits regularly, even in travel, and he ordered
performing it.

Prayer
431. AbU Dharr said: "The
Messenger of Allah iiij said to me:
'0 AbU Dharr! What will you do
when you will have leaders who will
destroy the prayers,' or perhaps he
said, '...delay it?' So I said: '0
Messenger of Allah! What do you

'Offer the prayer at its proper time,
then, if you catch it with them,
[pray it with them], for it will be
counted as a voluntary (prayer) for
you." (Sahih)
-i IJ L
Comments:
The meaning of 'destroy" the prayers is to delay them. In this case, a person
should perform the prayer in its proper time, and when attending the later
congregation, that later prayer will be considered a voluntary prayer in
reward, and this is applicable to all of the obligatory prayers.

deep voice, and (immediately) love
for him was placed in me (by
Allah). So I did not leave him until
I buried him in Ash-Sham (after
his) death. Then I searched for the
most knowledgeable person after
him, so I went to Ibn Mas'Ud and

This narration makes it clear that the Adhan was called as well as the Iqamah.
Al-Khattäbi said: "This Hadith was reported by Hisham, from Al-Hasan, from
'Imrãn bin Husain, and he mentioned the Adhãn in it. And it was reported by
AbU Qatadah Al-Anãri from the Prophet , and he mentioned the Adhan
and the Iqamah, and the additions (in narrations) when correct, are
acceptable, and acting upon them is Wajib." (Ma'ãlam As-Sunan)
Additionally, this narration contains: "Move to another location from this
place of yours where obliviousness overtook you," meaning "heedlessness,"
explaining the cause for moving from that location.
437. AN Qatadah narrated: "The
Prophet was once on a journey,
and he sidetracked (from the path),
so I went with him. He said:
'Look!' I responded: 'There is a
rider; these are two riders; these
are three riders...' until we became
seven. He said, 'Guard our prayer
for us,' meaning the Fajr prayer.
But they fell into a deep sleep, and
they were only awakened by the
heat of the sun. So they stood up
and continued for a short while,
then camped and performed
Wudü'. Bilãl called the Ad/ian, and
they prayed two Rak'ahs (Sunnah)
of Fajr, then prayed Fajr and
continued to ride (onwards). They
said to one another: 'We have been
careless in (performing) our
prayers.' The Prophet . said:
'There is no carelessness in sleep,

verily carelessness occurs only
while one is awake. So if one of
you unintentionally misses a prayer,
let him pray it as soon as he
remembers, and the next day at its
time." (Sahih)

obligatory prayer when praying that prayer late, and that the one who is
asleen is not accountable.

said that once a person led a group

Allah was looking (at him).
When he completed (the prayer),
the Messenger of Allah said:
"He should not lead you in
prayer." So he wished after that to
lead them in prayer, but they
prevented him, and informed him
of the statement of the Messenger
of Allah . The man mentioned
this to the Messenger of Allah ,

also said: "...you have offended
Allah and His Messenger." (Hasan)

The narrations of this chapter stress the sanctity of the Masjid, and that one is
not to spit in the Masjid, and that if one does that it must be removed, and
that if the Masjid has a soft floor or the like, then it may be buried, and if it
must be done during the Salat then it should be done under the left foot.

This is a distinctive characteristic of the Muslim Ummah, that the whole earth
is made pure for them, and they are allowed to prostrate anywhere on it, and
that pure earth is a means of purification according to other narrations.
Muslims have been granted the ease of offering the prayer wherever they
might be on the earth, except for a few places which have been mentioned in
various narrations.

In his Sahih, Al-Bukhãri (see before number 433) mentioned - without a
chain of narration, "It has been mentioned that 'All disliked performing $alat
in the lands of Babylon which had collapsed.' He also narrated a chain for
that in his Tarikh Al-Kabir, as did Ibn Abi Shaibah and 'Abdur-Razzaq. See
Taghliq At-Ta 'ltq by Al-Hãfiz Ibn Ijajar. Those narrations are not attributed
to the Prophet as in the case of this one. In the same chapter of his .ahih,
Al-Bukhãri narrated the Ijadith from Allah's Messenger i saying: "Do not
enter (the places) of those people where Allah's punishment had fallen unless
you do so weeping. If you do not weep, do not enter (the places of these
people) because Allah's curse and punishment which fell upon them may fall
upon you." - indicating support for the meaning of this narration.
492. It was narrated from AbU
Sa'eed that he said: "The
Messenger of Allah said;" - in
his narration, MUsã (one of the

Prophet said: "Command a boy
to offer As-Salãt when he reaches
the age of seven. And when he
reaches the age of ten, then (if he
does not offer A-alãt) discipline
him for it." (Hasan)
Mabarak are the places where the camels are kept. Other versions of this narration say
camel pens, or camel resting or watering areas. This wording gives the most general
meaning, referring to any area where the camels rest at, and the reason is explained.

Ghanam, translated here as goat, applies to both sheep and goats.

state between sleep and

Performed :L (A
(A i)
The word Adhãn means to pronounce and inform, and here, it refers to the
particular words by which the people are informed about the entry of the time
of one of the obligatory prayers (alat). The words of the Adhan are
pronounced with a loud voice, so that the people could hear the call. The
statements in the Ad/ian are a specific trait of the Muslim Ummah.
499. 'Abdullah bin Zaid narrated:
"When the Prophet ordered
that a bell be rung so that people
congregate for the prayer, I saw in
my dream a person coming to me
with a bell in his hand. So I said:
'0 servant of Allah! Will you sell
(me) the bell?' He said: 'What will
you do with it?' I said, 'We will call
people with it to the prayer.' So he
said: 'Should I not inform you of
something which will be better than
this?' I said: 'Yes, of course!' So he
said: 'Say: "Allahu Akbaru Allãhu

"Ac-alat went through three

I desire to send people out in the

desire to command people to stand

Muslims of the times of the
prayer."
He (Ibn AN Laila) said: "So they
started to use bells, or were about
to start to use them, until a person
from the Ansãr came and said: '0
Messenger of Allah! When I
returned after having seen your
concern, I saw in a dream a person
wearing two green garments. He
stood on the Masjid and said the
Adhãn, then he sat down a while,

similar, except that he said (in it):
"Qad qamatis-alat" (The prayer

talk about (me)" - Ibn AlAbU Däwud reported this narration from two Shaikh, 'Amr bin Marzuq, and
Muhammad bin Al-Muthanna.

said: "that you would say

AbU Däwud said: Then, returning
to the narration of 'Amr bin

Rak'ahs he had missed)..." -
Shu'bah said: "And I heard this
from Husain" - He said: "Mu'ãdh
said: 'I cannot see him (the Prophet
) in a state except that I too
(must be) in that state.' So he (the
Prophet ) said: 'Indeed, Mu'ãdh
has established a precedent for you,
so you too do as he did."
And he (Ibn Abi Lailä) said: "Our
companions informed us that when
the Messenger of Allah came to
Al-Madinah, he commanded them
to fast three days. Then (the ruling
to fast) Ramadãn was revealed,
and they were a people who were
not accustomed to fasting, so
fasting was very difficult for them.
Whoever would not fast, he would
instead feed a poor person. This
Verse was then revealed: So
whoever amongst you witnesses the
month, then let him fast itJ2
(After this) only the sick and
traveler were excused, and the rest
of them were commanded to fast."
He (Ibn Abi Lailã) said: "Our
companions informed us that a
(fasting) person could not eat if he
fell asleep (in the evening) before
having his meal, until the morning.

returned (after fasting), and
desired his wife, but she said: 'I

thought that she was trying to find
an excuse, so he approached her.
Another person of the Ancãr
returned home, and wished to eat,
but they (his family) told him: 'Let
us cook something for you.' So he
fell asleep (and was not able to

reported the entire Ijadtth. Ibn AlMuthanna only narrated the fact
that they prayed towards Bait AlMaqdis, and said (in it): "The third
stage was when the Messenger of
Allah initially arrived in AlMadinah, he prayed towards Bait
Al-Maqdis for thirteen months.

wherever you (people) are, turn

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
turned him towards the Ka'bah..."
and he completed the narration.
Nasr mentioned the name of the
person who saw the dream, and
said: "So 'Abdullah bin Zaid, one
of the men of the Ansar, came."
And he also said in it: "(The man
in the dream) faced the Qiblah,
and said: Allahu Akbaru Allahu

Then he remained (quiet) for a
while, then said the Iqamah in a
similar fashion, except that he said,
[1] Al-Baqarah 2:144.
The Book Of Salat (The Prayer) 318
after saying: ' -Iayya 'alal-falaii
(come to prosperity): Qad qamatissalat, Qad qamatL-salat' (the prayer
is about to begin, the prayer is
about to begin).
So the Messenger of Allah said:
'Reiterate it to Bilãl,' and Biläl
then said the Adhãn with it."
And he (the narrator) said with
regards to the fasting: "The
Messenger of Allah would fast
three days of every month, and he
would fast the Day of 'Ashürã'. So
Allah revealed: Fasting has been
prescribed for you as it was
prescribed for those before you, so
that you may achieve Taqwa. A
fixed number of days, but if any of
you are ill, or on a journey, the
same number (should be made up)
from other days. And for whoever
is able, let him pay a ransom the
feeding of a poor person.111So
whoever wished to fast would fast,
and whoever wished not to fast,
and instead feed a poor person,
was permitted to do so. This was
one stage, then Allah revealed: The
month of Ramadan is the month in
which the Qur'an was revealed - a
guidance for mankind, and a clear
proof for guidance and the
Criterion. So whoever sights (the
crescent moon of) the month, let
him fast it. And whoever is ill or on
a journey, then (he must fast) the
same number from other days. [21
After this, fasting was obligated on
the one who witnessed the month,
Eli Al-Baqarah 2:183, 184.
[2] Al-Baqarah 2:185.
The Book Of Salãt (The Prayer) 319
and the traveler was required to
make up (the missed) days. And
the old man and woman who could
not fast were required to feed (the
poor). So Sirmah came (home)
after working the entire day..." and

occurred early after the Hijrah, since it is confirmed later in the life of the Messenger of
Allah ; that Bilal would call the Adhan during the night, and then Ibn Umm MaktUm
would call the Adhan after him with the onset of Fajr. This is supported by the narration
recorded by Al-Bukhäri, Muslim, and others, wherein the Messenger of Allah ii said:
"Indeed Bilal calls the Adhän during the night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm MaktUm

Comments:
Tathwib is considered by most scholars to refer to the phrase which is uttered
twice during the Adhan, or first Adhan, of Fajr; "As-Salatu khairun-min-annawm" (prayer is better than sleep). In this narration, Tathwib refers to adding
other phrases or words in the Adhan. By the time of this event, Ibn 'Umar
had gone blind, that is why he asked his guide to take him away. In this
chapter, and the chapter about leaving the Masjid after the Adhan are two
strong and firm statements from Companions regarding the Adhan according
to the Sunnah. In the earlier chapter, AbU Hurairah stated about the one who
left the Masjid after the Adhan meaning an Adhan according to the
Sunnah - then he is disobedient, and in this chapter Ibn 'Umar left the
Masjid after the Adhan, and it is an Adhan that was contrary to the Sunnah.
Chapter 45. People Sitting

539. It was reported from Abãn
from Yahya, from 'Abdullãh bin
jLi I (>J)
(1
Lj3 '4:.: L1 -
['1 There are three meanings for Tathwib in relation to the Adhan, two of them preceded
and they are from the Sunnah: When the Mu'adh-dhin reaches either phrase including:
"I testify that" then he repeats it aloud after saying it silently to himself. See no. 500 and
those after it. The second is when the Mu 'adh-dhin says: "Prayer is better than sleep"
during the Adhan for Fajr, see also no. 500. The third - and it is thought to be the type
referred to here - is what At-Tirmidhi cited in his Sunan (after no. 198) from Ishaq bin
Ibrahim: "It was something innovated by the people after the Prophet 4N. It is when the
Mu 'adh-dhin calls the Adhan and the people are slow in coming, so between the Adhan
and the Iqamah he says: "Qad qãmati,c-a1at (prayer has been established) Haa 'alas -
salat (come to prayer) IJayya 'alal-falah (come to success)."
The Book Of Salat (The Prayer) 336
Abi Qatadah, from his father, that
the Prophet Qt said: "If the
Iqamah is called for the prayer, do
not stand up until you see me."
(Sahih)
Abü Dãwud said: This is how it was
reported by AyyUb and Hajjaj ASawwaf from Yahya. Ilishãm AdDastawã'i said: "Yaya wrote to
me (narrating it)." Mu'awiyah bin
Sallam, 'All bin A1-Mubãrak
reported it from Yaya, but they
said in it: "until you see me, and do
so calmly."
540. (There is another chain) from
Ma'mar, from YaIya with his
chain, similarly (as no. 539). He
said: "Until you see me exit (my

Abu Dawud said: "Until you see
me exit (my house)" was not
mentioned except by Ma'mar, and
Ibn 'Uyaynah reported from
Ma'mar, but he did not say in it:
"Until you see me exit (my

558. AbU Umämah reported that
the Messenger of Allah said:
"Whoever leaves his house to go to
an obligatory prayer after having
purified himself, his reward will be
like the reward of one who
performs Ijajj in the state of Irãm.
And whoever leaves to perform the
voluntary Vuha prayer - nothing
causes him to exert himself except
it - then his reward is like one
performing Umrah. And one prayer
after another prayer, in which there
is no vain talk between the two, is
written in the 'Illi)yin." (Hasan)
. Y I A/O:,-
Comments:
Performing voluntary prayer at home is superior and preferred, while it is also
allowed to do so in the Masjid. 'Illiyyin' is where the names and virtuous deeds
of the pious are recorded. See also the Tafsir of Ibn Kathir; Al-Mu(affifin

559. AbU Hurairah narrated that
the Messenger of Allah said:
"The prayer of a man in
congregation is twenty-five levels
(more blessed) than the prayer that
he prays in his house or in his shop.
This is due to the fact that one of
you, when he performs Wu1ü' and
does it well, and comes to the Masjid
only desiring the prayer, nothing
drives him - meaning, except the
prayer - then he does not take a
step except that he is raised one
level, and one sin is removed from
him, until he enters the Masjid.
Then, when he enters the Masjid, he
will (be counted as) being in the
prayer, as long as it is the prayer
which detains him. And the angels
pray upon one of you as long as he

Chapter 50. The Etiquette Of
Walking To The Masjid
562. AbU Thumämah Al-Hannãt
narrated that Ka'b bin 'Ujrah
caught him when he was going to

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
writes for him one Hasanah, 1' and
he does not raise his left foot
except that Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, will obliterate from him
one sin. So let one of you come
closer (to the Masjid) or go farther.
Then, when he comes to the Masjid
and prays in the congregation, he
will be forgiven. And if he comes
to the Masjid, and they have prayed
a portion (of the prayer), and a
portion is left, let him pray what he
catches, and then complete the
rest, it will also be the same (he
too will be forgiven). And if he
comes to the Masjid and they have
already prayed, and he prays (by
himself), it will also be the same

said: "What has prevented you

This means that one should not repeat the same obligatory prayer without any

Messenger of Allah je5, had said
such and such, and I was a young
boy who would memorize (quickly).
Because of this, I memorized a lot
of Qur'an. Once, my father went to
the Messenger of Allah as part
of a delegation of his people, so he
(the Prophet ) taught them the
prayer, and said to them: 'Let the
one who recites the most (Qur'an)
lead you.' Since I had memorized
so much, I was the one who recited
the most (Qur'an), so they told me
to lead them. I would lead them
wearing a small yellow Burdah, but
when I would prostrate, it would
raise up, exposing me. One of the
women said: 'Hide from us the
'Awrah of your reciter!'
Consequently they purchased for
me an Omani Qamis - nothing
caused me more happiness, after
accepting Islam, than my happiness
at (acquiring) it! So I continued to
lead them in prayer, and I was a
boy of seven or eight years."

Disliking the Imãm means when there is a lawful reason, it does not mean
those who dislike him because he follows the Sunnah or the like. The sin of
delaying prayer is established by other narrations, as well as enslaving a free

Comments:
Some scholars consider the order to offer prayers sitting, if the Imam offers the
Salat sitting to be abrogated, as for the other matters related to Salat, the
followers must do every action of prayer after the Imam completes the action.
For example, the followers should say the Takbir after the Imam says it, and the
followers should bow down after the Imãm when he bows down completely,
and similarly in the other positions of the Salat. See no.619 and the narrations
and chapters that follow it.

Khãlid, from Ibn 'Ajlãn, from Zaid

from the Prophet that he said:
"The Imam has been placed in

he added in this narration: "...and

Comments:
The meaning of 'Qamts," is a long robe (like what is called 'Thawb' today).
This narration proves the permissibility of praying in a long shirt, even if there
is no lower garment, or garment under it. If there is the possibility of such a
garment becoming loose, then it should be tied or fastened.

1. Praying in shoes or sandals, as well as not praying with them, is Sunnah. If
someone is praying while wearing shoes, he should ensure that his shoes are
clean, if there is some impurity on them, he should clean them by rubbing
them on the earth.
2. If someone is praying alone and wishes to place his shoes near him, he should
place them on his left side, and if he is praying with the congregation he
should place them in between his feet.
3. If unknowingly, a prayer is offered in unclean and impure clothes there is no
need to repeat it.

Hadith is that of the rows that the women pray in with the men, as for when
they pray separately, not with the men, then just like in the case of the men,
the best of their rows are the first of them, and the worst of them are the last
of them. And the meaning of the worst of the rows in the case of the women
and the men, is the least of them in reward and virtue. And the last of the
rows of the women when attending with the men, are only more virtuous,
because of their distancing themselves from mixing with the men and their
sight, and the heart being attached to them when seeing their movements and

Comments:
"Do not repeat it." The scholars differ in interpreting the various versions of
this Ijadith. Upon consideration of the various wordings, it appears to mean,
that one should not rush to the prayer, as in some narrations: "When you
come for prayer come with honor and dignity and whatever part of the prayer
you catch, join it, and whatever is left, complete it." See number 572, while it
is clear from the name of the chapter, that the author is using these two
narrations to prove not bowing outside of the rows.
684. (There is another chain) It
was reported from Al-Uasan that
AbU Bakrah once came (to the
Masjid) and the Messenger of
Allah was in Rukü', so he
bowed outside of the row, and then
walked up to the row. After the
Prophet finished the prayer, he
said: "Who among you was the one
who bowed outside of the row, and
then walked up to the row?" Abu

THE CHAPTERS RELATED
TO THE SUTRAH -)
The Sutrah refers to an object that a person should place, or have, in front of
him during the 5alat. The purpose of the Sutrah is to demarcate the area in
which one is performing Salat, allowing a pedestrian to cross beyond it, in
front of the person who is praying, since the Sutrah will act as a barrier
between the one passing by, and the one who is praying.

general, though, one should not pray at the places where people are talking or
busy in other worldly affairs as this may disrupt concentration, and similarly,
based upon this narration, one should avoid praying behind a sleeping person.

One stops the person from passing in front of them while they are performing
Salat, actual fighting will dictate that they are no longer performing Salat, and
therefore defeats the purpose of stopping them. Al-Khaflãbi said: "In this is
evidence that few actions do not sever the Salat, provided it is not lengthy."
Meaning, provided he does not become engaged in a matter aside from Salat.
So the meaning is to stop him, then grab him if necessary, and then to push
him back forcefully, if necessary, etc.

close to puberty. I crossed in front

Comments:
Those who say that the donkey does not sever the prayer argue that the
donkey crossed a part of the row, and there was no Sutrah in front of them,
and no one objected to that. But the Sutrah of Imam is sufficient for the
entire congregation, therefore, if anyone crosses in front of the row but
behind the Imam there is no harm.

and left the donkey in front of the
row, and they did not mind that.
And two young girls from the tribe
of BanU 'Abdul-Muttalib came and
entered between the rows, and they
did not mind that." (Hasan)

1. The Imam should have consideration and regard for those praying behind
him. He should keep the length of the prayer moderate.
2. The Companions thought of one lagging behind and skipping congregation
prayer as a hypocrite.

856. It was reported from Sa'eed
bin AN Sa'eed, from his father,
from AbU Hurairah that the
Messenger of Allah entered the
Masjid, and another man entered
as well, and prayed. He then came
to the Messenger of Allah and
said his Salam. The Messenger of
Allah returned his Salam and
said: "Return and pray, for you
have not prayed." So the man
returned and prayed in the same
manner that he had previously
prayed. He then .returned to the
Prophet and said Salãm. The
Messenger of Allah said: "And
upon you be the Salam; Return
and pray, for you have not prayed."
This occurred three times. The
man then said: "I swear by the One
Who has sent you with the truth, I
do not know how to pray better
than this, so teach me." So he
replied: "When you stand up to
pray, then say the Takbir. Then
recite what is easy for you of the
Qur'an. Then go into Ru/cu' until
you have achieved calmness in your
Ru/cu'. Then raise (your head) until
you have stood straight. Then go
into prostration until you have
achieved calmness in your

prostration. Then sit down until
you have achieved calmness in your
sitting. And do this in your entire
prayer." (Sahih)
Al-Qan'abi said 11 (in his
narration): "From Sa'eed bin AN
Sa'eed A1-Maqburi, from AbU
Hurairah." And he said in the end
of it: "If you do so, then your
prayer is complete, and whatever
you have deducted from these
(acts), you have deducted from
your prayer." And he said in it:
"When you stand up to pray, then
perfect (Asbigh) the Wuçiu'."

Messenger of Allah motioned to
him to remain in his place. AbU

the Messenger of Allah stood

both of them in a similar manner."
He said: "Then he sat,

sitting on it). He placed his left

right elbow at a distance from his

whether he heard other than the Hadith about Al- 'Aqiqah (see nos. 2837, 2838) - which
is a popular view. The author mentioned a letter here, and it is more clear in his
narration of the same chain under number 456; "Samurah wrote to his son." And this is
the same exact chain of narration, by which the author means that this narration came

Authentic Aifãdith prove using one's hands to get up after prostration. Most
of them considered this to refer to a sitting posture.
993. Ismã'11 bin Umayyah said: "I
asked Nãfi' regarding a person who
prays while the (fingers of his) two
hands are intertwined. He told me
that Ibn 'Umar said: 'That is the
prayer of those upon whom anger
has been shown." (Sahih)

once saw a man leaning upon his
left hand while he was sitting in the

In those early times, the Law was still being revealed. It could not be final as
long as the Messenger of Allah jii was alive since there was always the
likelihood of a certain law to be abrogated, amended or altered. That is the
reason the Companions kept quiet during the prayer. But, now, the situation
is different. Now a worshiper, while following the Imam, should caution him
and draw his attention, in case he errs or forgets.

that he has completed (the prayer),
let him prostrate twice. So if his

In case of doubt, one should act upon whatever is certain. For example, if one
is not sure how many Rak'ahs he has performed, two or three and four or
five, he should take the lesser number as the basis: two in the former case and
four in the latter case. Basing on this calculation, he should proceed to
perform the remaining Rak'ahs and complete his prayer.

Chapter 199,200. Whoever
Prayed Toward A Direction
Other Than The Qiblah, Then

1045. Anas narrated: "The
Prophet and his Companions
would pray towards Bait Al-Maqdis
(Jerusalem), then this Verse was
revealed: 'So turn your face
towards Al-Masjid Al-Haram; and
wherever you are, turn your faces
towards it.' 1' A person passed by
(the tribe of) BanU Salamah, and
they were in Rukü', praying Fajr
towards Bait Al-Maqdis
(Jerusalem). (He called out) twice:
'Verily the Qiblah has been
changed to the Ka'bah.' So they
turned around while they were in
Rukü' until they faced the Ka'bah."

Comments:
1. In case, a person prays with his face turned in a direction other than the
Qiblah unintentionally, his prayer is valid.
2. One who is not praying may instruct the other who is praying, if need be.
3. Such instruction does not invalidate a prayer. And Allah knows best.

Of Friday And The Eve Of
Friday[l]
1046. AbU Hurairah narrated that
the Messenger of Allah i said:
"The best day on which the sun
rises is Friday: On it, Adam was
created; and on it, he descended
(to earth); and on it, his
repentance was accepted; and on it,
he died; and on it, the Hour will be
established. And there is not a
single creature except that it awaits
(the Hour) on Friday, from the
time the sun appears (over the
horizon) until it rises (high) - out
of fear of the Hour - except for
Jinn and mankind. And on it there
is an hour that no Muslim catches
while he is praying, asking Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, for his
need, except that he is given it."
(AbU Hurairah then said:) "Ka'b
asked: 'This occurs once every
year?' So I replied, 'No, rather
every single Friday!' So Ka'b read
the Tawrah, and said,: 'The
Messenger of Allah ij has told the
truth.' I then met 'Abdullãh bin
Salãm, and told him about my
conversation with Ka'b. So
'Abdullãh bin Salam said: 'I know

This is a special kind of life, a peculiar state of existence after death, the
details of which we know not beyond revelation. Barzakh, an Arabic word,
refers to the barrier between this life and the Hereafter. This life of the
Messenger of Allah , as mentioned in the Hadith, relates to the realm of
Barzakh. We do not know its quality, characteristics, and other details. We
only believe in it, without going into its details.

in the early morning and sit on the

the one who comes an hour

two hours (before), until the Imam
comes. So if a person sits in a place
where he can listen (attentively)

quiet and does not commit Lagha
(act in vain), then he will have two
portions of reward. And if he
distances himself, and sits in a

have one portion of reward. And if
he sits in a place where he can

to pray any other obligatory prayer, until 'Asr, others say that the exemption
from the Friday prayer does not prove exemption from performing Zuhr.

increased, so 'Uthman ordered a

called at Az-Zawrã'. So this
became the custom." (Sahih)

Delivering the Khubah from the Minbar while standing is recommended. It is
[1] Meaning, it is known from that route, and it is believed that the Mursal narration is what
is correct.
121 The doubt in this narration is whether Ibn 'Umar merely intended that he sat for the
duration of the Adhãn, and one of the narrators added that commentary, or whether the
narrator said that in the narration, and the one who heard it from him was not sure if
that was part of it or not. This narration was reported from a group of narrators from
A1-'Umari (who narrated it here), and none of them said this statement in question here
except for 'Abdul-Wahhab bin 'Atã', who said it here. So it is clear that he is the one
who said it, and Allah knows best. This narration is repeated again after number 1131.

not permissible to do so sitting unless there is a reason to justify that. The

Comments:
The Messenger of Allah disliked the use of a single pronoun, denoting a
dual number, for both Allah and himself since, by doing so, there is a hint of
equating the Messenger of Allah with Allah. While the same statement
preceded from him jW,, in number 1097, but when the Messenger of Allah
said "them" he was speaking about himself in the third person, meaning, he
did not say: "whoever disobeys us..." but "whoever disobeys them," and this is
something that can only occur in his case.

Comments:
The Khutbah, and prayer after it, should be of a moderate length. These two
narrations demonstrate the approximate length. In number 1100, the author
narrated a version saying that Surah Qaf was the topic of the Khutbah, then
he narrated number 1102 which indicates it was recited during the prayer.
These narrations give an indication that both the Khubah and the recitation
were each about the length of that Sürah. See number 1106 and the chapter
related to it, stressing the brevity of the Khubah.

that the Prophet said: "Three
types of people attend the Friday

commits Lagha (acts in vain), and
that (action) will be his reward; a
person who comes and supplicates
to Allah, so if (Allah) wills, He will
give him, and if He wills, He will
not respond to him; and a man
who attends it, remaining quiet and
listening - he neither walked over
a Muslim's back nor did he harm
anyone. So (for this person) it will
be an expiation (for all sins) until
the next Friday, and an additional
three days. This is because Allah
says: Whoever brings a good deed

One should not perform voluntary prayers on the same place one has
performed the obligatory prayer. Changing one's place, or conversing with
"Apartment" or Hujrah; its meaning is not clear in this narration so it has been
translated in the more general way. In one of the narrations recorded by Al-Bukhãri it
mentions that its wall was short, and they could see him beyond it. For this reason and
others, Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said that this Hujrah in this narration may refer to an
occasion when he was performing the voluntary night prayer inside the Masjid, and he
would make some sort of temporary structure with "walls" using palm-reed mats, to
temporarily section off the area in which he was praying.

Ma'mar from Az-ZuhrI, from
'Abbad bin Tamim, from his
paternal uncle that the Messenger
of Allah went out with the
people to ask (Supplicate) for rain.
He prayed two Rak'ahs, reciting
aloud in them, and he turned his

hands, supplicating, and asking for
rain, and he faced the Qiblah."

1163. It was reported from AzZubaidi, from Muhammad bin
Muslim[']- this Hadith - with
his chain (a narration similar to
110-1162). He did not mention the
prayer, and he said: "And he
turned his Rida', such that its right

its left side was upon his right

his father narrated to him, that the
AmEr of A1-Madinah, Al-Walid bin
'Uqbah - according to 'Uthman
(one of the narrators): Ibn 'Utbah
- sent him to Ibn 'Abbas asking him
about the rain prayer of the
Messenger of Allah . So he (Ibn
'Abbas) narrated: "The Messenger
of Allah went out (meaning in the
open-out side the city), wearing
modest clothes, in a state of
humbleness and displaying
neediness (to Allah), until he came
to the prayer ground" - 'Uthman
(one of the narrators) added: And
ascended the Minbar - "And he did
not deliver any Khutbah such as you
do, but he continued to supplicate
and petition (Allah), and say the
Takbir. Then he prayed two Rak'ahs
as is performed for 'Eld." (Hasan)

correct is (Al-WalId) bin 'Utbah.

That it was like 'Eld prayer means that it was like it in duration, that no
Adhan was called, the number of Rak'ahs was the same, and the prayer
preceded the Khutbah, but the prayer for rain has no additional Takbirs.

'Aishah, that she said: "The people
complained to the Messenger of
Allah about the lack of rain. So
he ordered that his Minbar be
placed in the prayer ground
(Musalla), and he appointed a day
for the people to come out. The
Messenger of Allah went out
when the sun's rays could be seen,
and sat on the Minbar. He glorified
Allah and praised Him, then said:
'You have complained regarding
the lack of rain on your lands, and
the delay of rain from its usual
time. And Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, has commanded you to
supplicate to Him, and promised
you that He will respond to you.'
Then he said: 'A1-hamdulil!ãhi

maliki yawmid-din. La ilaha i!lãllãh,

anything, and we are the destitute
(always in need of You). Send
down rain upon us, and make what
You have sent down a sustenance
and a means to live by for a time
being).'
Then he raised his hands, and
continued to do so until the
whiteness of his armpits could be
seen. He then turned his back to
the people, and turned - or
turned upside down - his Ridã'
around while his hands were raised.
Then he turned around to face the
people, descended (from the
Minbar) and prayed two Rak'ahs.
So Allah caused a cloud to form,
and it sent forth its lightening and
thunder, then it rained by the
permission of Allah. The Prophet
did not return to his Masjid
except that streams had started
flowing (in the streets). So when he
saw how quickly they were looking
for shelter, he laughed so much that
his molars could be seen, and said:
'I testify that Allah is capable of
doing all things, and that I am the
slave of Allah and His Messenger."

Abu Dawud said: This Hadith is

" Meaning it is only narrated through one route of transmission.

1174. (It was reported from
'Abdul-'Aziz bin Suhaib and

drought once afflicted the
inhabitants of A1-Madinah during
the time of the Messenger of Allah
. So when he was delivering the
Khu!bah on Friday, a person stood
up and said: '0 Messenger of
Allah! Our horses have perished,
and our sheep have perished, so
pray to Allah to grant us rain.' So
the Messenger of Allah i%
extended his hands and
supplicated. And the sky was as
clear as glass! But the winds began
to blow, and clouds formed and
merged, then the skies poured
down rain. So we left (the Masjid)
wading through the water until we
reached our houses. And it
continued raining until the next
Friday. So that same man, or
perhaps another man, stood up and
said: '0 Messenger of Allah! The
houses have been destroyed, so
pray to Allah that He withholds it
(the rain, from us).' So the
Messenger of Allah smiled and
said: 'Hawalainã wa la 'alainã [(0
Allah!) Around us and not on us],'
and I saw the clouds splitting up
around Al-Madinah, as if they were
a crown." (Sahih)

go into Ruku', then stand, then go
into Rukü', then stand, then go into
Rukü', praying two Rak'ahs. In
each Rak'ah, there would be three
Ruku's; after the third one he
would prostrate. (He stood for such
a long time) that the men were
about to faint due to the length
that he stood, so much so that
buckets of water would be poured
over them. He would say "Allahu
Akbar (Allah is the Most Great)"
when going into Ruku': and when
he stood up: "Sami' Allahu liman
hamidah (Allah has heard those
who praise Him)." (He continued
praying) until the sun was visible
again, then he said: "Verily, the
sun and the moon do not eclipse
due to the death or life (birth) of
anyone, but these two (eclipses) are
of the signs of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, by which He frightens
His servants. So when they are
eclipsed, hasten to the Salãt."

Rak'ahs
1178. It was reported from Yabya,
from 'Abdul-Malik, that 'Atã'
narrated to him from Jãbir bin
Abdullãh, who said: "There was a
solar eclipse during the time of the
Messenger of Allah , and it
occurred the day that Ibrãhim, the
son of the Messenger of Allah lLi,,
died. So the people said that the
eclipse was due to the death of his
son Ibrahim.
Therefore, the Prophet stood in
prayer, and led the people in six
Rua 's in four prostrations. He said
the Takbir, then he recited (the
Qur'an) and made it a lengthy
recitation, then he went into Rukü'
for a period of time similar to what
he had stood, then he raised his
head and recited for a length of
time that was less than the first
recitation. Then he went into Rukü'
for a period of time similar to what
he had stood. Then raised his head
and recited a third time, slightly
less than what he had recited the
second time. Then he went into
Rukü' for as long as he had stood,
then raised his head, and went into
prostration, and prostrated twice.
Then he stood up, and performed
three Rukü's before he prostrated
every Rukü' was for a shorter
duration than the one before it,
and each Rua' would be similar to
the length that he had stood.
Then he moved backwards during
his prayer, so the row behind him

moved backwards as well, then he
went forward and stood in his usual
place, and the row went forward as
well. When he finished the prayer,
the sun had appeared again. He
said: '0 people! The sun and the
moon are two of the signs of Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime. They do
not eclipse due to the death of any
person. So when you see such (an
eclipse), then perform alãt until it
becomes clear again." And he

It does not mean that the Messenger of Allah performed Zuhr exactly at
midday (noon), before the sun had crossed the meridian. Rather, it means
that he said his prayer immediately after the sun had crossed the meridian
and then resumed his journey. It is quite obvious because the Zuhr prayer
time begins only after the sun had crossed the meridian.

Those who held the view that the
Imam shoud lead them while they -
are in two rows, and that they
should all say the Takbir with him,
The Book Of The Traveler's Prayers 57
then they all follow him in Ru/cu'.
Then the Imam and those in the
first row should prostrate, while the
second row should remain
standing, guarding them. Then,
when the Imam and the first row
stand up, those in the second row
should prostrate; then, the first row
should exchange positions with the
second row, such that they retreat
to where the second row was, and
the second row should move
forward to the position of the first
row. Then, all of them should
follow the Imam into Rukü', then
the Imãm should prostrate along
with the first row, while the second
row stands guard. Then, when the
Imam sits down along with the first
row, the second row should
prostrate; then they should all sit
down together, and say the Taslim
together.
AbU Dãwud said: This is the
opinion of Sufyan.

been given a time (in which they
were) inattentive. If only we had
attacked them while they were
praying.' So the Verse permitting
the shortening (of the prayer) was
revealed between Zuhr and 'Asr.
Therefore, when the time for 'Asr

Messenger of Allah went into

prostration, and the row that was
behind him also went into
prostration, while the others stood
guard over them. After these ones
(the first row) had prostrated twice
and stood up, those behind them
then prostrated. Then the row that
was behind him retreated to the
position of the other row, and the
rear row moved forward until they
were in the position of the first
row. Then the Messenger of Allah
went into Ruku' and they all
went into Rua' with him. Then he
went into prostration, and the row
behind him also went into
prostration, while the others stood
guard over them. When the
Messenger of Allah ç sat down
with the row that was behind him,
the others then prostrated, then
they all sat down together. He then
said the Taslim with all of them.
He prayed (in this manner) at

(to myself): 'I fear that there will be
(some problem) between me and
him that will cause me to delay the
prayer.' So I continued to walk and
prayed while walking - I would
motion (for the prayer) in his

him, he said to me: 'Who are you?'
I said: 'I am a man from the 'Arabs.
I have heard that you are gathering

the Prophet said: "Whoever
prays twelve voluntary prayers in a

because of it in Paradise." (Sahih)

Comments:
These glad tidings relate to Sunnah prayers said before and after obligatory
prayers. These are called Ratibah (fixed) or Mu 'akkadah (stressed). The
Hadith shows the importance of maintaining these Sunnah prayers. Other
Hadiths list four Rak'ahs before Zuhr prayer and two Rak'ahs after it, two
Rak'ahs after Maghrib prayer, two Rak'ahs after 'Ishã' prayer, and two Rak'ahs
before the Fajr prayer.
1251. 'Abdullah bin Shaqiq said: "I
asked 'Aishah regarding the
voluntary prayers of the Messenger
of Allah . She replied: 'He would
pray four (Rak'ahs) in my house

It is better if one performs these Sunnah prayers in one's house. It encourages

This is a reflection of Allah's order: 'Help one another to righteousness and
piety' (Al-Ma 'idah 5:2). We learn from this Hadith, that exhorting and urging
kinsmen and friends to do deeds of virtue and charity is something
commendable.
1309. It was reported that Abu
Sa'eed and AN Hurairah both said
that the Messenger of Allah
said: "If a man wakes his wife up at
night, and they both prayed, or
they prayed two Rak'ahs together,
they will be written among those
men and women who remember
Allah."
Ibn Kathir 1' did not narrate it in

Messenger of Allah .' She said:
'Do you not read the Our'an? For
the manners of the Messenger of
Allah was the Qur'an.'
So I said: 'Tell me about (his)
praying at night.' She replied: 'Do
you not recite: 0 you wrapped in a
garment 11?' I said: 'Yes.' She said:
'When the first part of this Sürah
was revealed, the Companions of
the Messenger of Allah iti stood
(in prayer) until their feet cracked,
and its ending was delayed in the
heavens for twelve months. Then
its ending was revealed, and so the
night prayer became voluntary after
it had been obligatory.'
"I said: 'Tell me about the W'ifr of
the Prophet ' She replied: 'He
would pray Witr with eight Rak'ahs,
sitting down only in the last of
them. Then he would stand and
pray one Rak'ah. He would only sit
in the eighth and ninth Rak'ah, and
he would not say the Taslim except
in the ninth. Then he would pray
two Rak'ahs while he was sitting
down. So this makes a total of
eleven Rak'ahs, 0 my son.
"When he became old, and gained
weight, he would pray Witr with
seven Rak'ahs, sitting down only in
the sixth and seventh Rak'ah, and
he would not say the Taslim except
in the seventh. Then he would pray
two Rak'ahs while sitting down,
thus making it nine Rak'ahs, 0 my
son. And never did the Messenger
of Allah stand the entire night
[1 Al-Muzzammil (73).
The Book Of The Voluntary Prayers 121
in prayer until the morning, and
never did he recite the (entire)
Qur'an in one night, and never did
he fast an entire month except for
Ramadãn. And whenever he
prayed any prayer, he would make
a habit of it. And if sleep got the
better of him at night, he would
pray twelve Rak'ahs during the
day.'
"I then returned to Ibn 'Abbas, and
narrated to him (what she had told
me). He said: 'By Allah, this is the
Hadith (that I wanted to hear), and
if I were only speaking with her, I
would go to her so that I could
hear it verbally from her.' So I said:
'If I knew that you were not
speaking to her, I would not have
narrated this to you!... (ahiz)

"This continued to be the prayer of

gained weight. Thereafter, he
reduced from the nine Rak'ahs two
Rak'ahs, and thus he would pray six

mention the four Rak'ahs. And he
continued citing it, and he said in
it: "And he would pray eight
Rak'ahs, making the length of their
recitations, bowings, and

sitting down in any of them except
for the eight one. In that one, he
would sit, then stand up without

"No, by Allah, 0 Messenger of

Comments:
Too much devotional worship that exhausts and ultimately destroys one's
health, and results in shunning required worldly pursuits, is contrary to the
Sunnah. In fact, it is like the monasticism practiced by Christians, and it is
forbidden in Islam.

1373. It was reported from 'Urwah
bin Az-Zubaiir, from 'Aishah, the
wife of the Prophet that the
Prophet once prayed in the
Masjid, and the people prayed
behind him, following him in his
prayer. Then he prayed the next
night, and the number of people
increased. Then they gathered
together on the third night, but the
Messenger of Allah did not
come out to them. When morning
came, he () said: 'I saw what you

did not come out to you is that I La

occurred in Ramadän." (Sahih)

1374. It was reported from AbU
Salamah bin 'Abdur-RahmAn from
'Aishah, who said: "The people
would pray in the Masjid in the
month of Ramadãn - each one
praying separately. The Messenger
of Allah asked me to place a
mat (in the Masjid), and he prayed
on it..." - narrating this incident.
She said in it: "So he said: '0
people! By Allah, I thank Him that
I did not spend the night headless
(asleep), nor was your position
unknown to me..." (Hasan)
1375. Al-WalId bin 'AbdurRahman narrated from Jubair bin
Nufair, from Abü Dharr, who said:
"We fasted with the Messenger of
Allah the entire month of
Ramadãn, and he did not lead us
(in night prayer) for any of it until
only seven nights were left. He
then led us (in prayer) until a third
of the night had passed. When
there were only six (nights left), he
did not lead us. When there were
only five (nights left), he led us
until half the night had passed. I
said: '0 Messenger of Allah! Why

for him.' And when there were four yHi
(nights left) he did not stand (in
prayer). When only three (nights)
remained, he gathered his family ç çJ
and wives and the people, and led
us (in prayer) until we thought that
we would miss the Falãh." He (the
sub-narator) said: "I said: 'What is
the Falãh?' He (AbU Dharr) said:
'The Saizür (pre-dawn meal). -
Then he did not lead us for the

with his prayer (behind him).' So
the Prophet said: 'They have
acted correctly, and what a good

AWl Däwud said: This Hadith is
not strong; Muslim bin Khälid is a

Chapter 2. Concerning Lailat
Al-Qadr (The Night Of Decree)
1378. It was reported from 'Asim
from Zirr, who said: "I asked Ubay
bin Ka'b: 'Inform us of Lailat AlQadr (the Night of Decree), for our
companion was asked about it, and
he said: "Whoever stands the
whole year will catch it!" He
replied: 'May Allah have mercy on
AM 'Abdur-Rabman, for by Allah
he knows that it is in Ramadan...
- Musad-dad (one of the
narrators) added: '"but he disliked
that they should rely on it, or he
liked that they not rely on it" -
then they (the narrators) were in
accord (in the rest of the
narration): "By Allah! Indeed it is
in Ramadan, on the twenty-seventh
night' - and he didn't say: 'If
Allah wills.' I asked him: '0 AbU
Pertaining To The Month
Al-Mundhir! How do you know
this?' He replied: 'By the sign that
the Messenger of Allah has told
us about it."
I ('Asim) said to Zirr: "What
sign?" He said: "The sun rises on
the day after it like a shield, having
no rays until it has risen." (aI!ziz)
143 A e

Comments:
1. Worship during Lailat A1-Qadr (the Night of Power) is better than that of a
thousand nights.
2. It is only an indication that the previous night was the Night of Power. If one
sees it, he should thank Allah for his good fortune, and if he did not, he
should long, and try for it the next year.
1379. Muhammad bin Muslim AzZuhri reported from Damrah bin
'Abdullãh bin Unais, from his
father, who said: "I was once sitting
in the gathering of BanU Salamah,
and I was the youngest of them.
They said, on the morning of the
twenty-first day of Ramadan: 'Who
among us will ask the Messenger of
Allah concerning the Night of
Decree?' So I left, and prayed the
Maghrib prayer with the Messenger
of Allah . I then stood by the
door to his house. He passed by me
and said: 'Enter,' so I entered. He
was brought his dinner, but saw
that I was not eating, due to its
small quantity. When he had
finished, he said: 'Hand me my
sandals,' and he stood up, so I
stood up with him. He said: 'It is as
if you have some matter (that you
wish to discuss).' I said: 'Yes! A
group of people from Banü
Salamah sent me to ask you
Pertaining To The Month 144
concerning the Night of Decree.'
He said: 'What night is this?' I
said: 'The twenty-second.' He
replied: 'It is this night,' then he
returned and said: 'or the next
one." Meaning the twenty-third.
(Hasan)

1380. Muhammad bin Ibrãhim
reported from Ibn 'Abdullãh bin
Unais Al-Juhani, from his father,
who said: "0 Messenger of Allah! I
have (a place) in the desert that I
am at, and I pray there, by the
grace of Allah. So command me
one night on which I should return
here to the Masjid." He said:
"Come on the night of the twentythird." So I said to his son: "What
did your father used to do?" The
son replied: "He would enter the
Masjid after praying 'Asr, and not
leave it for any reason until he
prayed Subh. So after he had
prayed Sub/i, he would find his
mount at the door of the Masjid,
and ride it until he arrived at his
place in the desert." (Ijasan)
Comments:
There are only three Masjids in the world for which one may make a journey,
with the intent to worship there for a higher reward. These are: Masjid AlHaram in Makkah, the Prophet's Masjid in Al-Madinah, and Masjid Al-A qsa
in Jerusalem.
1381. Ibn 'Abbas reported that the :3.c.LZ. Li- - IrM
Prophet said: "Search for it (the

The exact night of the Night of Power has been concealed, the purpose being
to awaken in people a strong desire to worship as much, and, as often as
possible, in a bid to get closer to Allah.
Chapter 3. Regarding Whoever
Said That It Is The TwentyFirst Night
1382. It was reported from AM
Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman, from
AM Sa'eed Al-Khudri, who said:
"The Messenger of Allah used
to perform I'tikaf in the middle ten
nights of Ramadan. One year, he
performed this I'tikf, then, on the
twenty-first night - which was the
night he usually left the I'tikaf -
he said: 'Whoever performed I'tikaf
with me, let him also perform
I'tikaf of the last ten nights. And I
was shown this night, but then was
caused to forget it. And I saw
myself in a dream, prostrating in
water and mud on the morning
following it.
So search for it in the last ten
nights, and search for it on every
odd night.'
AbU Sa'eed said: "So it rained that
night, and the Masjid's roof was
covered (with date-palm leaves),
and (the rain water soaked the
leaves and) it dripped. And with
my own eyes, I saw the Prophet

Comments:
During the group prayer, the followers follow the Imam; in the case of a
reciter outside of the prayer, if he recites a Verse of prostration and others
hear that, there is no connection between them as there is during the prayer.
Hence, the durations of their prostrations need not be the same. One may
perform a long prostration, the other a short one. One may lift up one's head
before the other. Similarly, if the reciter does not prostrate, the listener,
whether man, woman or child, may, with Wudü' or not.
1413. It was reported from 'AbdurRazzaq, that 'Abdullãh bin 'Umar

For he said in his narration of it:
"he performed the Qunut before

AbU Dãwud said: And it is not

them for twenty nights; he would
not pray the Qunut except in the
last half (of the month). When the
last ten nights would start, he
would not lead them, and instead
pray in his house. So they would
say, 'Ubayy has fled (like a slave)!"

Abü Dãwud said: This shows that

Comments:
Some scholars argue, on the basis of this Hadith, that it is not permissible to
say a voluntary prayer after Witr prayer. But other scholars dispute it, and
assert that it is commendable, and it is not impermissible, since the Messenger
of Allah himself performed a two Rak'ah voluntary prayer after he had
already performed War, according to authentic narrations.

Comments:
A War prayer (which consists of an odd number of Rak'ahs) may not be
changed into an even number of Rak'ahs. There is no authentic tradition of
Allah's Messenger j supporting that. So, if one is not in the habit of
performing Tahajjud prayer, then he should perform Witr prior to sleeping.

Since supplication is worship, it is quite obvious that supplicating to someone
other than Allah is a form of Shirk.
1480. It was reported from AbU
Na'ãmah, from a son of Sa'd, who
said: "My father heard me while I
was saying: "0 Allah! I ask you (to
grant me) Paradise, and its
blessings, and its glory, and its this,
and its that, and I seek refuge in
You from the Fire, and its chains,
and its scalding (water), and its
this, and its that." So he said: 'My
dear son, I heard the Messenger of
Allah say: "There will be a
group of people who will exceed
the boundaries of supplication," so
be careful that you are not among
them. If you are given Paradise,
vnhl will he. civen it with n1l that is
in it, ano it you are saveu rrom tne

being some hidden wisdom unknown to the person; 3. Or Allah may ward off
some evil from him or give him something else instead; 4. Or his prayer may

"The Messenger of Allah wrote

his sword. AbU Bakr acted upon
this (letter) until he passed away,

Upon five camels, there is one

Hiqqah is given, and for every

two-hundred sheep. If there is
more than two-hundred, then three
sheep are due, up to threehundred. If the sheep are more
than that, then for every onehundred sheep, one sheep is due,
and nothing needs to be given
unless one-hundred are reached.
"And different (flocks) should not
be joined together, nor should a
combined (flock) be separated for
fear of giving (extra) charity.
"Each partner (who has a share in
a combined flock) should pay the
adaqah in proportion to his
shares.
"And an animal that is old, or a
defective animal, will not be
accepted for charity."
Az-Zuhri said: "When the Zakat
collector comes, the sheep are to
be divided into three divisions: A
third of them should be the worst
(sheep of the flock), and a third of
them the best, and a third in the
moderate. And the one collecting
charity should take from the
moderate ones." And Az-Zuhri did

the statement of 'Umar bin AlKhattãb, May Allah be pleased
with him: "And different (flocks)
should not be joined together, nor
should a combined (flock) be
separated for fear of giving (extra)
charity," - as follows: "This is as,

The Book Of Zakät 248 13
for example, when each person (in
a company of three) has forty
sheep, and when the collector is
about to come, they combine them
all together, in which case there
will only be one sheep due. And a
case of when a combined flock is
separated is when two partners
each own one-hundred and one
sheep, so the total due on them
would be three sheep, but when the
collector comes, they divide the
flock among themselves, such that
each one of them only owes one
sheep. And this (explanation) is
what I have heard regarding it."
(Sahih)
1572. It was reported from Zuhair
that AbU Isbaq narrated to them
from 'Asim bin Damrah, and AlHärith bin Al-A'war, from 'All,
may Allah be pleased with him that
he said: Zuhair (one of the
narrators) added: "I think it was
from the Prophet " - "Give one
fourth of ten (2.5 %) - from every
forty Dirhams, one Dirhams. And
you do not have to give anything
until two-hundred Dirhams are
completed. So if there are two
hundred Dirhams, five Dirhams
need to be given. And whatever is
more is thus (proportionally)
measured.
"With regards to sheep, for every
forty sheep, one sheep must be
given. And if there are only thirtynine sheep, then nothing is due
upon you..." and he continued

The Book Of Zakat 249
elaborating on the Sadaqah on
sheep similar to what was said by
Az-ZuhrI".
Then he said: "With regard to
cows, then for every thirty, you
must give one Tabi', 1' and for
every forty, you must give one
Musinnah. 21 And nothing is due
on animals meant for manual
labor. With regard to camels..."
Then he mentioned the Sadaqah
for them as was mentioned by AzZuhri (no. 1570).
He said: "...and for twenty-five
(camels), five sheep must be given.
If there is even one more, then a
Bint Makhãd must be given, but if
one is not available, then one An
Labün may be given. This is the case
for up to thirty-five (camels), but if
there is even one more, then a Bint
Labün must be given, up to fortyfive. And if there is even one more,
then a Ijiqqah - one which a
stallion can breed with - is to be
given, up to sixty..." then he quoted
similar to the narration of Az-Zuhri.
And he said: "...so if there is even
one more than this (meaning nineone camels), then two Ijiqqahs
which stallions can breed with must
be given, up to one-hundred and
twenty (camels). And if there are
more camels than that, then for
every fifty, one Hiqqah is due.
"And different (flocks) should not
be joined together, nor should a
combined (flock) be separated for

fear of giving (extra) charity.
"And no old sheep whose teeth
have fallen off will be accepted in
charity, nor any defective sheep,
nor a male goat unless the one
giving charity volunteers to do so.
"With regards to produce, then a
tenth is due on whatever is
irrigated by (natural) streams or
rainfall, and half of a tenth (5 %)
is due on whatever is irrigated by
bucket (manually)."
In the narration of 'Asim and AlHãrith (it is): "Charity is due every
year" and Zuhair said: "I think he
said: 'One time."
And in the narration of 'Asim: "If
neither a lint Makhãi among
camels nor a Ibn Labun, then ten
Dirham or two sheep must be
given." (DaJ)

Isbaq, from 'Asim bin Damrah and
A1-Hãrith Al-A'war, from 'Au,
from the Prophet j'g. In part of the
beginning of this Ijadith he said:
"...So if you have two-hundred
Dirhams, and a year passes, then
five Dirhams are due upon it. And
nothing is due upon you -
meaning with regards to gold -
until you have twenty Dinars. So if
you have twenty Dinãrs, and a year

upon it. And if you have more,
then it will be proportional to
that..."

a Jadh'ah or Thaniyyah." 21 So I

separates, [21 then, the Bint Makhad
will be for the one year old until it
completes two years. When it
enters into its third, then it is a
Bint Labün. When it completes
three years, then it is a Iiqq (male)
and -Iiqqah (female) until its
completion of four years, because it
is the age of mating and breeding
with a stallion, and that is referred
to as Tulqah and the male does not
breed until he is two. They say that
the 1Iiqqah is bred with the stallion
because the stallion breeds with it

other animals, will have a different significance in those cases.

until it completes four years. When
it enters into the fifth, then it is a
Jadh'ah; until it completes five
years, then when it enters into the
sixth, and its secondary teeth
develops, it is at that time called a
Thani)y until it completes the sixth.
When it enters into the seventh
then the male is called (Raba'iya)
and the female Raba 'ijyah - until
it completes the seventh. So when
it enters into the eighth, and its
"sixth" teeth come in, that are after
the molars, then it is called Sadis
and Sadis up to the completion of
the eighth (year). When it enters
into the ninth its canines appear, so
it is called Bazil; meaning its
canines have Bazala meaning
"appeared." Until it enters its tenth
(year) then it is called Mukhlif.
Then (after that) there is no name
for it, rather it may be said Bãzilu
'Amin (a year Bãzil) or Bãzilu
'Amain (a two year Bãzil) and
Mukhlifu 'Amin (a year Mukhlif)
and Mukhlzfu Amain (a two year

to him, asking him regarding this.
'Umar wrote back to him: "If he

not, then those (bees) are bees of

Comments:
Since fruits like grapes and dates ripen gradually over a period of time, and
are eaten as they ripen, the procedure to assess the Zakãh is as follows: An
expert is asked to estimate how much the total produce would be when they
become ripe enough to be picked and gathered, deduct from it one-third or
one-fourth of it, and then Zakah is given for the remainder.
Chapter 15. Regarding
Estimation -

cover ourselves, and a part to lie
on. And we also have a container
which we drink water from." He

said: "Who will buy these two

"I'll take them for one Dirham."
So he said: "Who will give more
than a Dirham," two or three
times. A man said: "I'll take them
for two Dirhams," so he gave them
to him, took the two Dirhams, and
gave it to the Ansãri, telling him:
"Buy food with one (Dirham), and
take it to your family, and buy an
axe with the other one, and bring it
to me." So he brought it to him,
and the Messenger of Allah
attached a stick to it with his own
hands, and then said to him: "Go
and collect firewood, and sell it,
and let me not see you for fifteen
days." The man went collecting
firewood and selling it, and then
returned, with ten Dirhams. He
purchased a garment with some of
it, and food with some of it. So the
Messenger of Allah said: "This
is better for you than your begging
coming to you as a blemish on your

Begging is not allowed except for

A husband has to keep in view his income and expenditure and balance the

from AbU Hurairah, regarding a
woman who gives charity from the
property of her husband, that he
() said: "No, unless she does so
from her daily food, and in this
case the rewards will be shared

permitted to give charity from her

Comments:
Goats are weak and cannot bear hunger or thirst for long, nor can they
defend themselves against predatory animals. Hence, it is better to take hold
of them or, else, they may perish and go waste. Allah knows best.
1706. It was reported from Busr
bin Sa'eed, from Zaid bin Khãlid
Al-Juhani, that the Messenger of
Allah was asked about the lost
item that is found. He said:
"Announce it for a year, and if the
one who wants it comes for it, give
it to him. Otherwise, be familiar
with its pouch and drawstring, then
consume it. And if the one seeking
it comes, then give it to him."
(Sahih)
Comments:
This ruling also applies to animals like goats, in addition to other finds. In
case, it has been consumed, it is obligatory to pay the owner its price, in cash
or kind, as and when its owner turns up.
1707. It was reported from

anything of it, he will be fined
double its amount, and will be
punished. And whoever steals from

The Hajj pilgrims do not stay for long. They hurry back home on completion
of the rites of Haji. This makes year-long announcements of finds impossible.
It is, therefore, better not to pick up their lost things and, in case they are,
quick and repeated announcements should be made, or those things should
be deposited with the authorities dealing with lost and found articles.

Comments:
1. It is quite clear from this Ijadith that no woman may make a journey, not
even for Hajj, without a Mahram escorting her. If a woman cannot find a
Mahram to accompany her, she is considered not able to perform Ijaji and,
therefore, it is not yet obligatory for her.
2. A Mahram is a person whom a woman can never marry like father,
grandfather, uncle and nephew (paternal and maternal), son and father-inlaw.

In fact, this Hadith is a rejoinder to the those who maintain that when a
person has put a garland around the neck of a Hadi and sent it off, all the
obligations of a Muhrim become binding on him. The Hadith refutes their
contention. The truth is that nobody becomes a Muirim, that is, nobody
enters the ritual state of sanctity, unless he enters Ihram.

two Rak'ahs. Some people heard
this from him and memorized it.
He then mounted (his camel), and
once his camel had stood up, he
said the Talbiyah, and some people
heard this. This is because people
used to come to him in groups, so
they heard him say it (the Talbiyah)
when his camel stood up, so they
said: 'The Messenger of Allah J;

camel stood up.' The Messenger of

Literally, Qiran means "to join or connect." Technically, it means the intent
to perform Hajj and 'Umrah together. The procedure is to enter Ihram to
perform -Iajj and 'Umrah along with a Hadi. On reaching Makkah, the
pilgrim performs the rites of 'Umrah first but he is not free from the
obligations of Ihram upon the completion of the rites of 'Umrah. He remains
in Ihrãm until he has performed all the rites of Hajj. Only then shall he be

Chapter 56. The Description Of
The Prophet's Hail
1905.Ja'far bin Muhammad
narrated from his father, that he
said, "We visited Jabir bin
'Abdullah, and when we came to
him, he asked us to introduce
ourselves, until my turn came. So I
said: 'I am Muhammad bin 'All bin
Husain.' So he lowered his hand to
my head, and unbuttoned my top
and bottom buttons, then placed
his hand in between my chest -
and I was at that time a young boy
- and said: 'Welcome, and be at
ease, 0 nephew! Ask whatever you
wish.' So I asked him, and he was
blind. When the time for prayer
came, he stood up, and he was
wrapped in a garment. Every time
he tried to place it over his
shoulder, it fell off due to its small
size. He led us in prayer, and his
Rida' was next to him on a rack. I
then said: 'Inform me of the 11ajj
of the Messenger of Allah .'
"He motioned with his fingers until
he had closed nine of them, and
said: 'The Messenger of Allah 1
remained for nine years, not having
performed Ijajj. Then, in the tenth
year, he announced to the people
that he would go for 1Iajj. So a lot
of people came to Al-Madinah, all
The Rites Of Haf and 'Umrah 425
of them wishing to follow the
Messenger of Allah and do as
he did. The Messenger of Allah
left (Al-Madinah), and we all left
with him. When we came to DhUlHulaifah, AsmA' bint Umais gave
birth to Muhammad bin AbU Bakr,
so she sent someone to the
Messenger of Allah asking what
she should do. He replied:
"Perform Ghusl, and tighten a
cloth around your private part, and
enter the state of Ihram."
"The Messenger of Allah J
prayed in the Masjid, and then
mounted his camel Qaswa', until it
reached the peak of Al-Baidã'.
There were people in front of him
as far as my eye could see, riding,
and walking; and a similar amount
to his right; and a similar amount
to his left, and also behind him -
an amount equivalent to them.
And the Messenger of Allah
was among us, and to him the
Qur'an was being revealed, and he
knew its interpretation. So
whatever he did, we also did. The
Messenger of Allah began
uttering the Talbiyah of Tawhid:
"Labbaik Allahumma labbaik,
labbaika la sharika laka labaik!
Innal-hamda wan-ni'mata laka walmulk, lã sharika laka (I respond to
your call, 0 Allah, I respond. I
respond to Your call, You have no
partner. I respond to Your call. All
praise is for You, and all blessings
attributed to You, as is the
kingdom. You have no partner)."
And the people said the Talbiyah
as they say it (now), and the
The Rites Of Ha and 'Umrah 4j6
Messenger of Allah did not
prevent them from saying anything.
But he continued repeating his
Talbiyah. And we only intended to
perform Ijajj, not even being aware
of the 'Umrah, until, when we came
to the House with him, he touched
the (Black Stone) Corner, and
walked briskly for three circuits,
and (he walked) normally for four.
"He then went to the Station (of
Ibrãhim) and recited: 'And take
the Station of IbrähIm a place of
prayer.'t11He stood in such a way
that the Station was between him
and the House. - He said: "My
father would say: 'Ibn Nufail and
'Uthmän said: "I do not know but
that he mentioned that from the
Prophet ,,[2] - And he would
recite in the two Rak'ah: 'Say: He
is Allah, (the) One,'13' and, 'Say: 0
you who disbelieve.' 41He then
returned to the House and touched
the Corner (of the Black Stone),
and then exited from the door to
As-Safä.
"When he came close to A-Safã,
he recited: 'Verily, As-Safã and AlMarwah are of the Symbols of
Allah...,' 51and then he said: 'We
will start with what Allah has
started with,' and he begain with
A-Safa. He climbed on top of it
until he could see the House, and
he said the Takbtr, and exclaimed

supplicated between them, and
repeated these phrases three times.
He then descended to A1-Marwah.
When he went down the incline, he
walked briskly into the valley, and
when he had come back up, he
walked normally, until he reached
A1-Marwah, where he did as he
had done on As-Safa. When he

said: '0 Allah! I enter Ihrãm for

'In that case, I have the Hadi with

"On the Day of Tarwiyah (the
eighth of Dhul-Uijjah), when they
set out for Mind, they all entered
into flzrãm for Ijaff. The Messenger
of Allah rode (to Mina), and
prayed Zuhr and 'Asr, and Maghrib,
and 'Isha', and Subh there. He then
waited for a while until the sun had
risen, and commanded that a tent

continued onwards, and the
Quraish did not doubt that he
would stop at Al-Mash'ar Al-Ha ram
of Al-Muzdalifah, as they would do
in the days of Jahiliyyah. But the
Messenger of Allah pressed
onwards until he arrived at
'Arafah, and saw the tent that had
been placed for him at Namirah.
He encamped there, until the sun
had begun its descent. He then
commanded that his camel AlQaswa' be readied, and mounted it
until he reached the center of the
valley. He delivered a sermon and
said: 'Your blood and wealth is
sacred to you, just as the sanctity of
this day, in this sacred month, in
this sacred place. Verily, everything
that occurred in Jahiliyyah is under

Someone among these (narrators)
said: "He had been sent to the

foster him, but the tribe of Hudhail
killed him" - 'And the interest of
Jahiliyyah has been abolished. And
the first interest that I abolish is
our own: The interest due to

of it is abolished. Fear Allah with
regards to women, for you have
taken them (in marriage) with the
trust of Allah, and their private
parts have been made permissible
for you with the words of Allah.
And your right upon them is that
they do not allow anyone that you
do not like to tread on your
bedding. If they do (some sin), hit
them without causing any wounds.
And their right over you is their
sustenance, and their clothing,
according to what is customary.
And I have left amongst you
something that you will never go
astray after: The Book of Allah.
And you will be asked about me, so
what will you say?'
"They said: 'We testify that you
have given and passed on (the
Message), and been sincere.' So he
raised his pointer finger to the sky
and then lowered it toward the
people, saying: '0 Allah, bear
witness. 0 Allah, bear witness. 0

"Then Bilal called the Adhãn and
Iqamah, and he prayed 7uhr, then
he called the Iqamah and he

prayed 'Asr, and did not pray
anything between them.
"He then rode Al-Qaswa' until he
arrived at the place (of Mount
'Arafah), and he made his camel's
back face the rocks, and (stood)
such that the throng of pedestrians
was in front of him. He faced the
Qiblah, and remained standing
until the sun had set and its
brightness lessened — until its last
portion disappeared.
"He placed Usãmah behind him
(on his camel), and went on. But
the crowd had squeezed Al-Qasw',
such that its head was hitting the
front of the saddle, and he ()
was saying, motioning with his right
hand: 'Gently, 0 people! Gently, 0
people.'
"Whenever he reached a hillock,
he would loosen its reign so that it
could ascend. He then came to AlMuzdalifah, and combined between
Al-Maghrib and 'Ishã' (prayers)
with one Adhãn and two Iqamahs"
— 'Uthmãn (one of the narrators)
said: "And he did not pray any
voluntary prayers in between
them." — Then they (the
narrators) were in accord.
"The Messenger of Allah then
lay down until dawn broke, upon
which he prayed Fajr when the
light of dawn had become clear to
him" - Sulaimãn (one of the
narrators) said: "With the Adhãn
and Iqamah." Then they (the

then rode Al-Qaswã' to the AlMash'ar Al-Haram and ascended

added: "And extolled His

"And he remained standing until it
became very bright. Then the
Messenger of Allah departed,
before the sun actually rose, and
placed Al-Façll bin 'AbbAs behind
him (on his mount) - and he was
a man with beautiful hair, of a fair
complexion, and well-built. Every
time a woman in her riding-tent
passed by, he would look at them,

commanded 'Ali to sacrifice the
remaining ones, so he shared the
sacrificial animals with him. He
then ordered a small portion from
every camel be taken to be cooked
in a pot, and they ate from its meat
and drank from its broth. He then
rode (his camel), and went to the
House, praying Zuhr in Makkah.
He then.- went to BanU 'AbdulMuttalib while they were drawing
out Zamzam (water), and said:
'Keep taking it out, 0 BanU

fact that people would eventually
take your (rights) of drawing the

1. Those who performed Hajj together with the Messenger of Allah ,
numbered ninety thousand or, according to some, one hundred and thirty
thousand Muslims.
2. It is better to slaughter the sacrificial animal by one's own hands. The
Messenger of Allah ç, sacrificed as many animals as the years of his age. In
addition to the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah, there are three more days of sacrifice
(Ayyãm At-Tashriq) but the first day of sacrifice is the best since the
Messenger of Allah , did all his sacrifices the first day.
3. The Tawaf on the 101h of Dhul-Hijjah is a pillar (Rukn) and a fundament of
Hajj. It is also called TawafAl-Ifadah

Staying at the plains of 'Arafat is a pillar (Rukn), one of the fundamental rites
of Hajj. One must stay there, even though briefly. Its time begins from the
ninth of Dhul-Hijjah, after the sun has crossed the meridian, and ends just
before Fajr on the following day. Whoever fails to stay at 'Arafat, then he has
not performed Haj].

It is more correct to say that the Messenger of Allah ç, performed four

two 'Umrahs, she did not count the 'Umrah of Al-Hudaibiyah, because the
Messenger of Allah was denied passage to Makkah by the pagans, and he
had to go back to Al-Madinah without performing it. She also did not count
the 'Umrah he did along with Ijajj. In view of this, it may be said that he
performed only two 'Umrahs independently and separately.

Comments:
Expounding the foregoing IIadith, Al-Khattabi has dealt with it exhaustively.
To put his exposition briefly, what the Messenger of Allah said concerns
vows. That is, if a person has vowed to offer a prayer in a certain Masjid, he
has the choice to either pray in that very Masjid or any other Masajid, for all
Masajid are equal. But if he has vowed to pray in any of the three aforementioned Masajid, it becomes obligatory on him to fulfill his vow. The
reason is that these are special Masjids, the Masjids of Prophets. We have
been commanded to follow them.

Sacredness Of A1-Madinah

inviolable as Makkah.
3. Muhdith, and it may be read: Muhdath, the first is more popular as it appears
in our text, and it refers to one who aids or harbors the criminal. The
meaning of Muhdath is the innovated thing itself., for which "giving refuge"
would mean accepting and abiding by it. See Minnat A!-Mun 'im.

It is an authentic Hadith. "It is: She does not prevent one who intends
immorality with her; or, she does not prevent anyone who seeks something
from her husband's wealth." ('Awn Al-Ma'büb) See An-Nasã'i nos. 3231 and
3494. And they say it means simply that she, being a dignified and respectable
woman, does not feel alienated or repelled by strangers (and yet is not guilty
of immoral conduct). Thereupon, the Messenger of Allah counseled him
to divorce her, but when he told him his weakness, he let him keep her.
2050 (A). It was reported from
Mustalim bin Sa'eed the son of the
sister of MansUr bin Zãdhãn, from
MansUr, meaning Ibn Zädhãn,
from Mu'awiyah bin Qurrah, from
Ma'qal bin Yasãr, who said: "A
man came to the Prophet and
said: 'I have encountered a woman
of nobility and beauty, but she
cannot give birth. Should I marry
her?' He said: 'No.' The man then
came to him a second time, but he
prohibited him. He then came for
the third time, and the Prophet
said: 'Marry loving women who
give birth, for I will compete with

you against other nations."

It does not mean that there is an absolute ban on marrying a barren woman.
In fact, a marriage has many motives. Marrying such a woman is permissible,
even desirable, for some reasons.

Chapter 9. (About) Who Was
Made Prohibited Through
Adult Fosterage
2061. 'Aishah and Umm Salamah
both narrated: "AbU Hudhaifah bin
'Utbah bin Rabi'ah bin 'AbdushShams had adopted Sãlim — just
as the Messenger of Allah had
adopted Zaid - and he married
him (Salim) to his niece, Hind bint
Al-Walid bin 'Utbah bin Rabi'ah.
Sãlim was a freed slave of an
Ansãri lady. In the days of
Jãhiliyyah, an adopted son would be
called by his adopted father's
name, and would inherit from him.
This continued until Allah
The Book Of Marriage 508
revealed: 'Name them by their
father's...' up to His saying: '...your
brothers in faith, and your freed
slaves.' 1' So their names were
then restored to their father's, and
the one whose father was not
known became a Mawlã and a
brother in religion. The wife of AbU
Hudhaifah, Sahlah bint Suhail bin
'Amr Al-Qurashi A1-'Amiri came
and said: '0 Messenger of Allah, we
used to consider Salim a son, and he
would live with me and AbU
Salamah in one house, and see me as
I am (normally in my home). And
you are aware of what Allah has
revealed regarding them (adopted
children), so what do you think
should be done with him (Salim)?'
He replied: 'Breast-feed him.' So
she breast-fed him five breastfeedings, and he became like a
foster-son to her." And so 'Aishah
would follow that decision, and
would command her sister's
daughters and brother's daughters
to breast-feed five times those whom
'Aishah wished to visit her, even if
he was an adult, and they would then
visit her. As for Umm Salamah and
the rest of the Prophet's ii wives,
they refused to allow anyone to visit
them after such a breast-feed, unless
he was breast-fed while an infant.
And they would say to 'Aishah: "By
Allah, we do not know, for this
might have been a concession from
the Prophet to Sãlim, specifically
for him and not for anyone else."

Comments:
A woman's close relatives who decide important matters relating to her are
called "legal guardians" (Awliya', singular: Wall). Her paternal relatives
('Asabah) have priority over her other relatives, according to most scholars. In
case she has no relative, the ruler is her Wall (legal guardian). The ruling that
no adult girl or woman may be married without the permission of her legal
guardian is based on the textual evidence in the Qur'an and Hadith. AbU
Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: "No woman should
arrange the marriage of another woman, and no woman should arrange her
own marriage. The adulteress is the who arranges her own marriage." (Sunan
Ibn Majah, Ijadith 1882).

Chapter 25/26. Regarding
Suitability
2102. AbU Hurairah narrated that
AbU Hind cupped the Prophet
on his scalp. The Prophet said:
"0 BanU Bayadah, marry (your
daughters) to Abu Hind, and
propose to him (for his
daughters)." And he added: "And
if there is any good in any of the
medicines that you cure yourselves
with, it is in cupping." (Hasan)

Comments:
"His scalp" Al-Yafukh; the crown of the head, where the bone of the skull
from the front meets the bone from the rear of the head. Abti Hind Yasar
was a freed slave of Banti Bayadah, yet the Messenger of Allah &told them
to intermarry him with his people. This is enough to prove that suitability of
partners or, say, matching should be based on piety and character, not on
caste.

Chapter 26/27. Marrying
Someone That Is Not Yet Born
2103. MaimUnah bint Kardam
narrated: "I went with my father
for Haff with the Messenger of
Allah , and I saw the Messenger
of Allah . My father came close
to him, and he (the Prophet )
was atop a camel of his, so he
stopped and listened to him, and
he had a small stick with him -
the type that is used to discipline
schoolchildren - I heard the
Bedouins and the people say:
'(Make way for the one) with the
stick, (make way for the one) with
the stick, (make way for the one)
with the stick.' So my father
managed to come close to him,
held on to his stirrup, and testified
to his (Messengership). The
Prophet 40, stopped to listen to
him, so he said:
-'I was present at
the army of 'Athrãn - Ibn AlMuthanna (one of the narrators)
said: "Gathran." - Tariq bin AlMuraqqa' said: "Who will give me
a spear, in return for its prize?" I
said: "And what is its prize?" He
replied: "I will marry the first
daughter that is born to me to
him." So I gave him my spear.
Then I did not see him, until I
heard that a daughter had been
born to him, and had become of
age. I came to him, and said:
'Prepare my wife for me (to take)!'
But he swore that he would not
give her to me until I gave her a
new dowry - other than what I
had already given him (the spear).
The Book Of Marriage 530
And I too swore that I would not
give him anything other than what
I had already given him."
The Messenger of Allah asked:
"And of what age is she now?" He
replied: "She has now grown white
hair." The Prophet said: "I
think that you should leave her,"
but this verdict startled me, and I
looked at the Messenger of Allah
. When he saw that (expression)
on me, he said: "Neither you nor
your companion is sinful." (Da'if)

Jãhiliyyah, and the heat afflicted
their feet. A person among them
said: 'Whoever gives me his
sandals, I will marry the first
daughter born to me to him.' So
my father took off his sandals, and
threw them at him. A daughter was
then born to him, and became of

Comments:
One Uqiyyah is forty Dirhams of silver. Hence, the amount of twelve and a
half Uqiyyah comes to five hundred Dirhams. According to more modern
rates, one Dirham is 2.975 grams of silver, and, according to some earlier
scholars, 3.06 grams.
2106. AbU Al-'Ajfa' As-Sulam! : i - •

Comments: -
A rich or well-to-do person may give more in a dowry (Mahr). It is not
forbidden, providing the intention is not to show off. To give large sums of
money as a Mahr for ostentation or to force the groom to do so, or the groom
withholding it - all would be improper. Likewise, it is also wrong for a wellto-do man to fix a small amount of Mahr.

1. A marriage agreement without a specified Mahr is valid but it obligates the
groom to pay a Mahr similar to that normally paid to other women of the
bride's family, like her mother, sister, etc - in the event that the husband dies.
2. A woman whose husband died before the consummation of marriage shall
complete her 'Iddah (the legally prescribed period of waiting during which a
woman may not remarry after being widowed or divorced) prior to
remarriage.
2117. 'Uqbah bin 'Amir narrated
that the Prophet told a man:
"Are you satisfied if I many you to
so-and-so?" He said: "Yes." And
he asked the woman: "Are you
satisfied if I marry so-and-so to
you?" She replied: "Yes." So they
were married to one another, and
the man consummated the
marriage without specifying the
dowry amount, and he did not give
her anything (as dowry). He had
participated during Al-Iludaibiyyah
- and everyone who had
participated in Al-Hudaybiyyah had
been allocated a share of (the
produce of) Khaibar. So when he
was about to die, he said: 'The
Messenger of Allah married me
to so-and-so, and I did not specify
her dowry, nor did I give her
The Book Of Marriage 538
anything, so I call you to witness
that I have given her as dowry my
share of Khaibar.' So she sold her
share for a hundred thousand."
Abu Dawud said: In the beginning
of the Hadith, 'Umar bin AlKhattãb added - and his narration
is more complete: "The Messenger
of Allah said: "The best
marriage is the easiest one." And
the Messenger of Allah said to
the man..." and he quoted its
meaning.
Abü Dawud said: It is feared that
this Ijadith may have an addition in
it, for this was not the case.

2164. It was reported from Ibn
'Abbas, that Ibn 'Umar made a
mistake, and Allah will forgive him.
Rather, this (Verse was revealed)
regarding a group of Ansãr - and
they had been pagans, and a group
of Jews - and they were People of
the Scripture. The Jews would
think that they were superior to
them in knowledge; therefore the
Ansãr would follow them in many
of their ways. And of the ways of
the People of the Scripture was
that they would only approach their
women from the side, for that is
the most covered a woman can be.
And this group of Ancar had .taken
this act from them. As for the
Quraish, they would spread their
women in a manner that was
objectionable to them, and would
enjoy them from the front and
from the back, and while lying
down. So when the Muhãjir arrived
in Al-Madinah, a man from among
them married one of the ladies of
the Ansãr, and he desired to do the
same with her, but she
reprimanded him, and said: 'We
used to be approached from our
sides, so either do the same, or
don't come near me!' And their
matter spread (among the people),
until the Messenger of Allah
heard of it. At this, Allah revealed:
'Your women are as a tilth to you,
so approach your tilth as and when
you please...', meaning: from their
fronts, and from their backs, and
while they are lying down, (but as

about that, at which Allah
revealed: 'They ask you regarding

abstain from women in their

Verse.111The Messenger of Allah
j then said: 'Interact with them in
their houses, and do' everything
except intercourse.' The Jews then
said: 'This person does not leave
any affair of ours except that he
differs with us in it!' So Usaid bin
Hudair and 'Abbad bin Bishr came
to the Messenger of Allah . and
said: '0 Messenger of Allah, the
Jews have said such and such, so
should we not also have intercourse

full of pebbles, or date-pits. And
there was a black slave-girl of his
(sitting on the floor) below him.
He would perform Tasbiii with the
stones, until he had finished what
was in the bag, upon which he
threw the bag at her upon that the
slave-girl collected them and
returned the bag to him. He then
said: 'Should I not tell you about
the Messenger of Allah iI and I?'
I said: 'Yes!' He said: 'Once, I was
cleaning my teeth (with a Siwak) in
the Masjid when the Messenger of
Allah entered and said: 'Where
is the lad from Daws (Abu
Hurairah)?' three times. A man
said: '0 Messenger of Allah, he is
over there in the corner of the
Masjid, brushing his teeth.' So he
walked towards me until he
reached me. He placed his hand
upon me, and said some good
words. I stood up, and he walked
to the place where he led the
prayer. He then turned to face the
congregation, and there were two
rows of men and one row of
women, or one row of men and
two rows of women. He said: 'If
Shaifãn causes me to forget
anything in the prayer, then let the
people say Tasbih, (i.e., say,
Subhan Allah) and let the women
clap.' He then led the people in
prayer, and he didn't forget
anything in it. He then said: 'Stay
The Book Of Marriage 567 .atS J
in your places, stay in your
places..." - MUsã (one of the
narrators) added: " over here.
Then, he praised Allah and
glorified him, and said, 'Amma
ba'du 'As to what follows -" then
the narrators were in accord: "He
then faced the men and said: 'Is
there any man among you who
goes to his wife, closes the door,
and draws the curtain, thus
screening himself with the screen
of Allah?' They said: 'Yes.' He
continued: 'Then he sits afterwards
and says: "I did this, I did that?"
But they, too, remained silent at
that. He then turned to the women
and asked: "Are they any among
you who discuss this?" But they
remained silent. Then a young girl
who had just passed puberty rose
up on one of her knees, and stood
up above the rest so that the
Messenger of Allah ç could see
her and listen to her, and said: '0
Messenger of Allah, verily the men
talk about this, and the women talk
about it.' He said: 'Do you know
what the example of that is? The
example of that is like a female
Shaitãn who meets a male Shaitãn,
and he uses her to satisfy his
desires while people look at them.
Verily, the perfume of men is that
whose scent is apparent and not its
color. Verily, the perfume of
women is that whose color is
apparent and not its scent."
- Abu Dawud: From here I
memorized it from Mu'ammal and
Musa: "Verily, let no man (sleep)
with another man in a blanket, nor
The Book Of Marriage 568
a woman with another woman,
except if it be her son or father,"
and he mentioned a third, but I
forgot it, and it is in the narration
of Musad-dad, but I do not
remember it as precisely as I would
like. Musa said: "Hammäd
narrated to us from Al-Jurairi,
from AbU Nadrah, from AtTufawL" (DaJ)

Comments:
1. These Ahadith are related to the meaning of the first Verse of the Sürat AtTalaq: Divorce them during their (legal waiting) period (65:1), that is, divorce
them during the time they are in a state of purity, provided no intercourse
takes place during this time.
2. Divorcing a woman during the period of her menstruation is contrary to
Sunnah. However, if one divorces one's wife during those days, the majority
of scholars consider it a valid divorce.
3. If a woman has been divorced during her period of menses, that divorce shall
be considered as one divorce, and the husband shall be told to retract. The
right to retract rests with the husband, not with the legal guardian.

added: "And the Prophet

Abu DãwUd said: This Hadith was
reported from Ibn 'Umar by YUnus
bin Jubair, Anas bin Sirin, Sa'eed
bin Jubair Zaid bin Aslam, AbU
Az-Zubair, and MansUr who
reported it from AbU Wä'il, and
with all of them is the meaning that
the Prophet commanded him to
take her back until she became
pure, then, if he desired, he should
divorce her, or if he desired, he
should keep her.
AbU DãwUd said: And this is how
Muhammad bin 'Abdur-Rahmãn
reported it from Sãlim, from Ibn
'Umar. As for the narration of AzZuhri from Sãlii, and that of Nãfi'
from Ibn 'Umar, (its meaning is)
that the Prophet commanded
him to take her back until she
became pure, and then
menstruated, and then became
pure, and then if he wished, he
could divorce her or keep her.
Abu Dawud said: And it has been
related from 'Atã' Al-Khurãsãni,
from Al-Hasan, from Ibn 'Umar,
similar to the narration of Nafi'
and Az-ZuhrI, and all of these
narrations contradict what AbU AzZubair said.

2196. It was reported from Ibn

Prophet :, informed him from
'Ikrimah, the freed slave of Ibn
'Abbas, from Ibn 'Abbãs, that he
said: "Abd Yazid, the father of
Rukanah, and his brothers,
divorced Umm Rukanah, and
married a woman from Muzainah.
She (the woman from Muzainah)
came to the Prophet and said:
'He is as useful to me as this hair,'
and plucked a hair from her head:
'So separate us from each other.'
The Prophet became angry at
that, so he called for Rukãnah and
his brothers, and asked those who
were seated with him: 'Do you see
that so-and-so resembles Abd
Yazid in this way, and this one
resembles him in that way?' They
said: 'Yes.' So the Prophet said
to Abd Yazid: 'Divorce her,' and
he did so. Then he said: 'Take back
your wife, the mother of Rukänah
and his brothers.' He said: 'I
divorced her three times, 0
Messenger of Allah!' He replied, 'I
know. Take her back,' and then
recited: 0 Prophet! If you divorce
women, then divorce them at their
prescribed times..." 11 (Da'iJ)

his father, from his grand father
that Rukãnah divorced his wife
irrevocably (A1-Battah), and the
Prophet returned her to him 11
- it is more correct, because the
son and family of a man are more
knowledgeable of him. So Rukãnah
only divorced his wife with an
irrevocable divorce and the
Prophet counted it as one.

he would return her to him. Then
he said: 'One of you goes and

cries out, "0 Ibn 'Abbas! 0 Ibn

that if a man divorced his wife

marriage with her, it would be
counted as one during the time of

In case, the couple are separated, their child, providing he is of sound
judgment, shall be given the right to choose any of the two. As for the child
lacking such ability, scholars have different opinions. For example, a male
child will remain in custody of his mother for seven years and a female child
for nine years. Later, they will be handed over to the father.

'Uwaimir bin Ashqar Al-'Ajlani
went to 'Asim bin 'Adi and said:
"0 'Aim, what do you think if a
man found another man with his
wife - should he kill him, in which
case you would then execute him,
or what else should he do? 'Asim,
ask the Messenger of Allah on

asked the Messenger of Allah ,
but the Messenger of Allah i&,
disliked this issue, and criticized it,
so much so that 'Asim felt
distressed because of what he
heard from the Messenger of Allah
f1. When 'Asim returned to his
family, 'Uwaimir came to him and
said: "0 'Asim! What did the
Messenger of Allah say to
you?" He replied: "You did not
bring me any good! The Messenger
of Allah disliked the issue that I
asked him about." 'Uwaimir said:
"I swear by Allah, I will not stop
until I ask him myself about it." So
'Uwaimir then went to the
Messenger of Allah liJ while he
was sitting among the people, and
said: "0 Messenger of Allah! What
do you think if a man found
another man with his wife -
should he kill him, in which case
you would then execute him, or

Messenger of Allah ii said: "Some

If a husband discovers adultery committed by a wife but he does not have
four witnesses to testify to that, he may go to the court and swear four times
before the judge that his wife has committed adultery, and swears the fifth
time invoking Allah's curse upon himself if he were lying. Then the woman
swears four times that he is a liar, and she swears a fifth time invoking Allah's
wrath upon herself in case his allegation is true. This procedure is called Li'ãn
(cursing). This is followed by a permanent separation of the husband and
wife, and the marriage is dissolved.
2246. It was reported from -
Muhammad bin Ishaq, that 'Abbas - - - -- -

The couple were separated because the marriage agreement had been
revoked by Li'ãn, not by divorce. The Messenger of Allah ; did not give him
a command to divorce his wife. There was no need for that. The Messenger
of Allah ruled that they were to be separated. This separation is
permanent and irrevocable. This obviates the need to utter the statement of
divorce.

The inference is that a husband who refuses to claim the unborn baby in the
womb of his wife (that is, denies he is the biological father of the unborn
baby), the judge has the right to separate the couple through Li'an. In this
case, the child shall be related to (and named after) its mother.
2253. It was reported from
'Alqamah, from 'Abdulläh (Ibn

lash him. And if he kills him, then
you would kill him. And if he
remains silent, he will remain silent
while he is incensed with anger. I
swear by Allah, I will ask the
Messenger of Allah about it.' The
next day, he came to the Messenger
of Allah and asked him: 'If a man
finds another man with his wife, and
speaks about it, then you would lash
him. And if he kills him, then you
would kill him. And if he remains
silent, he will remain silent while he

"The Prophet said: '0 Allah!

continued to supplicate, so the

"And it was this man who was
afflicted with this (problem) from

with his wife to the Messenger of
Allah , and they pronounced the
curse on one another. The man
swore four times by Allah that he is
among the truthful ones, and then
invoked Allah's curse upon himself
if he were among the liars. She
then went to pronounce the curse,
but the Prophet said to her; 'Be
cautious!' But she refused, and did
it. When they both turned away,
the Prophet said: 'Perhaps she

2254. It was reported from Hisham
bin Hassan, that 'Ikrimah narrated
to him, from Ibn 'Abbas that Hilãl
bin Umayyah accused his wife of
committing adultery with Shank
bin Sahmã'. He made this
accusation in front of the Prophet
, who then said: "Bring the
evidence, or else the penalty (will
be inflicted) on your back." He
said: "0 Messenger of Allah, if a
person sees another man on his
wife, should he go and find
evidence?" But the Prophet
continued to say: "Bring the
evidence, or else the penalty (will
be inflicted) on your back." Hilal
said: "I swear by the One Who has
sent you with the truth as a
Prophet, I am indeed telling the
truth. And of a surety, Allah will
reveal about me something which
will free the penalty from my
back." So the following was
revealed: "And those who accuse
their wives, and have no witnesses
besides themselves..." and he
continued reciting until; "he is
among the truthful ones."
The Prophet then turned away
and called for both of them. They
both came, and Hilãl bin Umayyah
stood and testified. And the Prophet
said: "Allah knows that one of
you two is lying, so will either of you
repent?" She then stood up and
testified, but when she was at the
fifth one - that may the anger of

one that will inflict it (the anger of
Allah upon you)." So she faltered,
and hesitated, until we thought that
she would recant, but she said: "I
will not humiliate my people for the
rest of time!" And she went ahead
(with the curse). So the Prophet
said: "Watch her carefully: if she
brings forth (a child) whose eyes are
very black, with large buttocks and
heavy shins, then it is Shank bin
Sahma's (child)." And she came
with (a child) with those
descriptions, so the Prophet
said:, "Were it not for the fact that
the (rulings) of the Book of Allah
have already preceded, I would have
had another matter (to deal) with
her." (Sahih)

replied: 'He has lied.' The
Messenger of Allah said: 'Have

he swore by Allah four times that

him: '0 Hilãl! Fear Allah, for the

curse) is the one that inflicts the

will not whip me due to her.' He
then testified that the curse of
Allah would be upon him if he
were of the liars. She was then
asked to testify, so she swore by
Allah four times that he was lying.
When it was time for the fifth, she
was told: 'Fear Allah, for the

curse) is the one that inflicts the
punishment upon you.' So she
hesitated for some time, then said:
'By Allah, I will not disgrace my

time that the punishment of Allah
would be upon her if he were
telling the truth.
"The Messenger of Allah then

accused (of adultery), nor her child
(of being illegitimate), and that
whoever accuses her or her child
(of that) should be punished. And
he also ruled that she does not
have the right of a house or any
sustenance from him, since they
were to be separated without a
divorce or death. And he said: 'If
she brings him (the child) having a
reddish complexion, with small

if she brings him dark in color, with
curly hair, and a heavy frame,

"So she delivered him, dark in

frame, having thick shins and large
buttocks. The Messenger of Allah

Comments:
If a child is claimed by several persons or a woman is suspected of having
slept with several persons, it being unclear whose child it is, an expert and
honest physiognomist may be asked to decide the issue. If physiognomy were
a false science, the Messenger of Allah jiAf, would not rejoice at the statement
of the physiognomist.
Chapter 31/32. Those Who Said
That Lots Should Be Drawn If
They Differ About The Child (n )
2269. It was reported from
'Abdulläh bin Al-Khalil, from Zaid
bin Arqam, who said: "I was sitting
with the Prophet when a person
came from Yemen and said: 'Three
people from the people of Yemen
came to 'All arguing over a child.
And they all had intercourse with a
woman, in the same time frame,
between two cycles. He asked two
of them: "Give up the child to this
one,'' but they became
argumentative. Then he said to
another two: "Give up the child to
this one," but they became
argumentative. The he said to
another two: "Give up the child to
this one," but they became
argumentative. So he said: "You
are a group of partners (in the act)
who are differing with each other. I
am going to draw lots between you,
so whoever pulls (the correct) lot
will get the child, and he must pay
the other two companions twothirds of the blood money." And
he then gave (the child) to the one
who won the lot.' At this, the
Messenger of Allah laughed (so

hard) that his molar teeth, or his
incisors, could be seen." (Da'if)

2270. It was reported from 'Abd
Khair, from Zaid bin Arqam, who
said: "When 'All, may Allah be
pleased with him, was in Yemen,
three people were brought to him.
They had all engaged in
intercourse with a woman, in the
same time frame, between two
cycles. He asked two of them: 'Will
you agree to give the child to this
one?' They both replied: 'No.' And
he asked all of them similarly, but
every time he would ask any two,
they would respond, 'No.' So he
drew lots between them, and then
gave the child to the one who drew
the lot, and also made him pay two
- thirds of the blood money. This
was then mentioned to the Prophet
, who laughed until his molars
could be seen." (Hasan)

(VA1:)
Comments:
When both the sides of a matter (pros and cons) seem to be almost the same
or of an equal weight and it becomes difficult to decide, it is then permissible
to decide the issue by means of lots as 'All, may Allah be pleased with him,
did, or, as the Messenger of Allah jW, used to do for choosing any one of his
wives to accompany him on his journey.
2271. It was reported from
Salamah, that Ash-Sh'abI heard
from Al-Khalil or Ibn Al-Khalil,
who said: "A woman was brought
:

The Book Of Divorce 76
to 'All, may Allah be pleased with
him, and she had given birth from
three men." He narrated similarly,
but he did not mention Yemen,
nor the Prophet , nor 'All's
asking the other two to give up the
child (to the third). (Da'ij)
Chapter 32/33. Regarding The
Types Of Marriages That Were
Practiced Before Islam
2272 'Aishah, may Allah be
pleased with her, the wife of the
Prophet , narrated that there
were four types of marriages that
were practiced in Jahiliyyah. There
was a type which is what the people
do today: A man would propose to
another man (guardian) for his
female ward's (hand in marriage),
and would give her a dowry and
then marry her. Another type was
that a man would say to his wife,
after she had finished her menses:
'Call so-and-so, and mate with
him,' and her husband would avoid
her until it was clear that she was
pregnant from that other man
whom she was mating with. After
her pregnancy was apparent, her
husband could then enjoy her if he
pleased. And they would only do
that type because they desired a
bright (and noble) child. This type
of marriage was called: 'Mating
marriage.' Another type of
marriage was that a group of men,
less than ten, would visit a woman,
all of them enjoying her. So if she
became pregnant and gave birth,
then a few nights after her delivery,
The Book Of Divorce 77
she would call for all of them, and
none of them could refuse to come.
When they would all gather, she
would say to them: 'You know (the
result) of what you have done, and
I have given birth, and he is your
child: 0 so-and-so,' and she would
name whomever she pleased, so
her child would be considered his.
And the fourth type was that a lot
of men would enter upon a woman,
for she would not turn away any
that came to her - and these were
the prostitutes. They would place
flags on their doors, and these
would act as signs; whoever wanted
them would enter in upon them. If
she became pregnant and gave
birth, then after her delivery, they
would all gather and call a Qafah.
Then the child would be given to
the one whom he saw fit, and so it
would be given to him, and called
his son. None could refuse that. So
when Allah sent Muhammad it,
he obliterated all the marriages of
the People of Jãhiliyyah except for
the marriage of the Muslims today.

Comments:
All these cases date back to the Age of Jahiliyyah when such nasty things were
common and the pagans did not feel ashamed of children born out of
wedlock. But Islam has ruled the child "belongs to the owner of the bed."
From the face of the child in the afore-mentioned case, it appeared that he
was the son of 'Utbah, and that he was an illegitimate child, but in his case
the rule was followed and he was given over to "the owner of the bed."

This authentic Hadith proves that, until a mother marries again, she has the

that AbU 'Amr bin Hafs divorced
her irrevocably, and he was not
present (in the city). So he sent his
representative to her with some
barley, but she considered this to
be very little. He replied: "I swear
by Allah, you do not have the right
to (receive) anything from me!" So
she went to the Messenger of Allah
and mentioned that to him. He
told her: "You do not have the
right of maintenance from him."
And he commanded her to observe
her waiting period in the house of
Umm Shank, then he said: "She is
a woman whom my Companions
visit. Observe your waiting period
in the house of Ibn Umm MaktUm,
for he is a blind man and you may
take off your garments. When you
have completed (your waiting
period), inform me." She said: "So
when I had finished (the waiting
period), I mentioned to him that
Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan and Abü
Jahm both proposed for my hand.
The Messenger of Allah said:
'As for AbU Jahm, his stick never
leaves his shoulders. And as for
Mu'awiyah, he is poor, having no
wealth. Many Usamah bin Zaid.'
But I disliked that, so he said

Comments:
The opinion of Marwãn bin Hakam, 'Aishah, and 'Umar bin Al-Khattãb was
that an irrevocably divorced woman had a right to be provided a place to live
during her 'Iddah, and that the husband must provide that. But the statement
of Fãtimah bint Qais is clearer and has more weight, especially because she
was the woman in this case, and it was she who had been divorced. So,
obviously, her statement, quoting the Prophet , that 'an irrevocably
divorced woman had no right to maintenance and housing' has more weight.
The foregoing Verses of the Qur'an seem to suggest that they concern women
who have been given revocable divorces, not those irrevocably divorced.

It is inferred from this Hadith that just another wedding is not enough, but
normal marital relation between the divorced wife and her second husband
must take place. If the second husband divorces her without this marital
relationship, the woman shall not be lawful for her first husband. Hence,
those who marry a thrice divorced woman with the intention to make her
lawful for her first husband, in fact, commit adultery, since this conditional
marriage is not a valid marriage.

believe! Fasting is prescribed for
you, as it was prescribed for those
before you. "During the lifetime
of the Prophet , when the people
prayed Al- 'Atamah (Salat Al- 'Ishã')
it became unlawful for them to eat
and drink and have intercourse with
women. They would fast till the next
sunset. A man deceived himself by
having intercourse with his wife
after he had prayed 'Ishã', and did
not break his fast. So Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, intended to
make that easier for those who
remained, and grant them
permission, and benefit. Allah, the
Glorious, said (the Verse): Allah
knows that you used to deceive
yourselves ... 21And by this Allah
benefited people, a grant for them
and ease." 31 (Hasan)

to the command of Allah, abstains, from dawn to sunset, from all things that
would invalidate his fast, such as food, drink, and sexual activity. These things
are normally permitted in life but prohibited during the fast.
2314. AbU Isaq reported from A]-
Bard', who said: "When a man
fasted, then slept, he would not eat
until the next (sunset). Sirmah bin
Qais Al AnãrI'1was fasting, and
he came to his wife and asked her:
'Do you have anything (to eat)?'
She replied: 'No, but I will go and
seek something for you.' While she
was away, sleep overpowered him.
When she saw him asleep upon her
return, she said: 'What a
disappointment for you!' Thus by
midday of the following day he
fainted, as he used to work all day
long on his land. That was
mentioned to the Prophet , and
the following was revealed: It is
made lawful for you to have sexual
relations with your wives on the
night of fast....' He recited up to: of
dawn. 21 ($ahih)
Comments:
On the face of it, this Hadith seems to be in conflict with the one before it,
for it states that until then, the rule was that even if a person that had fasted
in the day had a nap after Ijtãr (regardless of whether he had performed his
'Ishã' prayer or not), the door of having food, drink and sexual relations was
legally closed for him. Scholars of Hadith, however, see no conflict between
the two and suggest that either of the two actions (sleep or 'Isha' prayer) was
cause enough to bar a person from indulging in those acts until the next Iftãr
time. Thereafter, Allah granted the permission to perform those acts from
Eli Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (after no. 1915 of Al-Bukhäri) discussed, at length, the variations
reported for his name. His preference was, AbU Qais, Sirmah bin Abi Anas, and he
indicated that all of the variations indicating differently are merely mistakes in citing his
name.

There is an allowance for men and women who are either too old or are not
able to bear fasting, to pay the compensation in lieu of the missed fast. The
concession also applies to pregnant and breast-feeding women whose babies
might be at risk if they fast. Such women can forgo the fast for the time being.
There is, however, a difference of opinion in this later case, as to whether or
not they shall make up for their missed fasts later on.
Chapter 4. The Month May Be
Twenty-Nine Days
2319. It was reported from Sa'eed
bin 'Amr, meaning Ibn Sa'eed bin
Al-'As, from Ibn 'Umar, who said:
"Allah's Messenger , said: 'We
are an unlettered nation, we cannot
write nor calculate. The month is
thus, and thus, and thus." (One of
the narrators) Sulaimän closed one
of his fingers the third time,
indicating that a month is twentynine days, and (sometimes) thirty.
(Sahih)
J5+ ) 3L L
Comments:
"We are an illiterate nation" may be understood in the historical context that
reading and writing was rare in the Arab society of those days. Very few
people knew it.
2320. Nãfi' reported from Ibn
'Umar, who said: "Allah's
Messenger said: 'The month
consists of twenty-nine days. Do
not fast until you see it (the
crescent) and do not break the fast
until you see it (the crescent). If it
is cloudy, then complete thirty
days."
He said: "So when it was the
twenty-ninth of Sha'bãn, Ibn 'Umar
The Book Of Fasting 111
would appoint somebody to sight .
the crescent for him. If it was
sighted then so (he would fast). If
it was not sighted, and there was -
no cloud or dust on the horizon, he c1~J :J9 JL
would not fast the next morning. If j
it was not sighted due to clouds or
dust, he would fast the next
morning." He said: "And Ibn
'Umar would end his fasting along
with the people, without counting
this way. (Sahih)

2321. AyyUb said: " 'Umar bin
'Abdul-'Aziz wrote to the people of
Al-Barah: 'It has been conveyed to
us, from the Messenger of Allah
- similar to the (previous)
narration of Ibn 'Umar, from the
Prophet . And he added: "The
best means of calculation is that if
we sight the crescent of Sha'bãn on
such and such date,11' then Allah
Willing, the fast will begin on such
and such date unless the crescent is
sighted before that." (pa'rJ)

2322. Ibn Mas'Ud said: "We fasted
with the Prophet for twentynine days, more often than we
fasted with him for thirty days."

Comments:
Twenty-nine days of fasting carries as much merit and reward as of thirty days
since the deciding factor is one's sincerity and obedience to the commands of
Allah.
2323. It was reported from 'AbdurRahmãn bin AN Bakrah, from his - - - -
father, from the Prophet je , that he '- '
said: "The two months of 'Eld are

Chapter 5. When The People
Are Mistaken In Sighting The
Crescent.
2324. It was reported from
Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, from
AbU Hurairah - and he mentioned
the Prophet in it, he said: "Your
breaking of the fast ('Eld Al-Fi?r) is
the day that (all of) you break your
fast, and your sacrificing ('Eld AlAdha), is on the day that (all of) you
sacrifice, and all of 'Arafat is a place
of standing, and all of Mina is a
place for slaughtering, and all of the
mountain paths of Makkah are a
place of slaughtering, and all of Jam'
(Muzdalifah) is a place of halting."

Meaning, when the Muslims recognize it to be these days, then the reward is in

Chapter 6. When (Sighting the
Crescent for) The Month Was -
Obscured
2325. 'Abdullãh bin AN Qais said:

AbU Dãwud said: Sufyan and

Chapter 7. Whoever Said That

(The Crescent), Then Fast
Thirty Days
2327. It was reported from Simak,
from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn 'Abbãs,
who said: "The Messenger of Allah
said: 'Do not precede the
month by fasting a day or two,
except if one has been in practice
of fasting on a particular day, and
do not fast until you sight it (the

it. If it is obscure due to weather,
then complete the count of thirty
(days), and then break the fast.
The month (may be) twenty-nine
days. (Da 'if)
Abu Dawud said: It was reported
with similar meaning by Ilãtim bin
Abi Sagirah, Shu'bah and Al-Hasan
bin Salib, from Simãk, but they did
not mention: "and then break the
fast."
Abu Dawud said: He is Hãtim bin

Comments:
This Hadith might apparently seem to be in conflict with the preceding one.
The disparity, however, is resolved when we consider the fact that this
permission or instruction is only meant for the person who is already under a
vow to observe the fasts, or has constantly been observing those fasts on those
particular days. No other person who is neither under a vow nor has been
accustomed to observing those fasts but wishes to keep them as voluntary
fasts is allowed to do so.
2329. AbU Al-Azhar Al-Mugirah
bin Farwah said: "Mu'awiyah stood
among the people in Dair Misbal
which is at the gate of Him. He
said: '0 people! We have sighted
the crescent (of Sha'bãn) on such
and such day. We will fast in
advance (in Sha'bãn before
Ramadan). Anyone who likes to do
so, he may do so." He said: "Malik
bin Hubairah As-Saba'i stood up
and said: '0 Mu'awiyah! Did you
hear this from Allah's Messenger
or is it something from your
opinion?' He replied: 'I heard the
Messenger of Allah saying:

I said: "I saw it on the night of

yourself?" I said: "Yes, and the
people (also) saw it, and they
fasted, and Mu'awiyah fasted." He
said: "But we saw it on the night of
Saturday, so we will not stop

man who was in a certain land and
he fasted on Monday. Two men
testified that they sighted the

The dawn is of two types: The false dawn, and the true dawn. Su5fur may be
eaten as long as the false dawn lasts, but its time ends as soon as the true
dawn appears. Bilãl used to call the Adhãn during the false dawn, in order to
alert the people. The false dawn is when the whiteness of light begins to
ascend towards the sky, but then a more enduring whiteness appears and
spreads horizontally all around. This signals the true dawn of the morning.

"The Messenger of Allah said:
'The Ad/ian of Bilãl should not

Comments:
The time for Iftãr begins immediately upon the setting of the sun. Waiting
after sunset or delaying Iftar as a precautionary measure has no meaning. The
Ijadith also gives us the golden rule that, in order to remove any possible
doubts in the minds of the people, it is sometimes a good idea to let people
have further clarification even regarding "obvious" matters.

Fast, as a rule, can be broken with any type of food or drink that is
permissible, while dates or water are the most blessed for that purpose.

A1-Bunäni, that he heard Anas bin
Mãlik saying: "The Messenger of
Allah would break his fast with
fresh dates (Ruab) before praying,
if there were no fresh dates, then

not have dried dates, then he
would take some mouthfuls of
water." (Hasan)

Time Of Breaking The Fast
2357. Marwân - meaning Ibn
Salim Al-Muqaffa' - said: "I saw
Ibn 'Umar take hold of his beard
and trim whatever exceeded the
palm. He said: The Prophet .
used to say, when breaking his fast:

'urüqu wa thabatal-ajru in shã 'Allah
(The thirst is gone, and the veins
are quenched, and the reward is
assured - if Allah wills)." (Hasan)
Comments:
The practice of trimming the part of the beard beyond the fistful is reported,
with authentic chains of narration, from other Companions aside from Ibn
'Umar, and he also is one of those that reported the order to grow the beard
from the Messenger of AllAh jLe,. See no. 4199.
2358. It was reported from Husain,
from Mu'Adh bin Zahrah that he
conveyed to him that the Prophet
used to say when breaking fast:

There is difference of opinion among the scholars on the necessity of making
up in such case. The dominant opinion, however, is that making it up is
required.

Comments:
A Muslim, as a rule, is commanded to abstain from things like vulgar and
obscene talk and other activities of the Days of Ignorance. And when he is
fasting, it is all the more important that he observe abstinence from all evil
activities in all circumstances. Rather than engaging in disputes, he is advised
to plainly declare to his opponent that he is fasting, so that all doors to any
bad conduct are shut.

Ahmad and apparently the author.

Damascus a distance as much as is
between the village of 'Aqabah and
Al-Fustat in Ramadan, and that is
three miles. He then broke his fast,
and some people broke their fast
along with him, but some of them
did not like to break their fast.
When he returned to his village, he
said: "By Allah! Today I saw
something which I never dreamt of
seeing. Some people detested the
guidance of the Messenger of Allah
and his Companions,"
addressing it to those who fasted.
He then said: "0 Allah! Take me

'Aqabah is a place at a distance of about twenty-two km. from A1-Madinah

The three days after 'Eld Al-Adha (meaning the 11th, 12th, and 13th of DhulHijjah) are known as the Days of Tashriq and especially for those performing
Hajj; the Days of Mind. The reason why they are called Days of "Tashrtq" is
because the dried pieces of the flesh of sacrificial animals appear shining in
the sun during these days.

2429. AbU Hurairah said: "The
Messenger of Allah ç said: 'The
most virtuous fast, after the month
of Ramadan, Allah's month AlMuharram, and the most virtuous
alãt after the obligatory $alãt is
prayer during the night."
In his narration, Qutaibah (one of
the narrators) did not say: "month,"
he (merely) said: "Ramadan."
(Sahih)
2430. It was reported from tii- -
Uthman, meaning Ibn Hakim, that
he said: I asked Sa'eed bin Jubair :
about fasting during Rajab. He i. Li :JU
said: "Ibn 'Abbas informed me: • - -
'The Messenger of Allah used

Comments:
Rajab is one of the four sacred months, and it can be said in the light of this
Hadith that the Messenger of Allah fasted many days of this month. It may
also mean that, like other months, in this month as well he fasted and did not
fast, in turns. Thus there is no special ruling nor command concerning fasting
during this month.
Chapter 56. Regarding Fasting
In Sha'bãn
2431. 'Aishah, may Allah be
pleased with her, said: "The most
beloved of months to fast for the
Messenger of Allah was
Sha'ban, then he would join it with
Ramadan." [11 (Sahih)
Comments:
Sha'bãn is a month of immense excellence. The Messenger of Allah i was
wont to fasting excessively in this month. He is also known to have said that
the deeds of men are presented before Allah in this month, and that he
also wished that his deeds were presented while he was fasting. (Sunan AnNasã'i, no. 2359).

Comments:
The implication of this narration in relation to the chapter heading is that
Jihad will remain as the group that is victorious upon the truth will fight the
Dajjãl. It is the belief of AN As-Sunnah Wal-Jama 'ah that Jihad with every
Muslim leader of a land abides.
Chapter 5. Regarding The
Reward Of Jihad. - - -
2485. It was reported from Abu- :JJI "I YEAO
Sa'eed that the Prophet was -
asked: "Who among the believers
are most most perfect in Faith?" He
said: "A man who fights (Jihad) in - - -
the cause of Allah with himself and Ji S'ULI 4J :
his wealth, and a man who
worships Allah in a pass among the L L5 L
-
•n mountain passes, who has t .•:
protected the the people from his -
evil." (Sahih) ct L5
Comments:
This IIadith mentions two traits of Faith, which appear unrelated. The first
listed is Jihad in the Cause of Allah. The second is seclusion to protect people
from one's evil. These are in reality related, because the one who flees to
seclusion protects the people from his evil, by not lending his hand to
sectarian strife and bloodshed which they claim is Jihad, demanding him to
participate in.
Chapter 6. Regarding The
Prohibition Of Wandering (AsSiyahah) ']

said: 'Saha in the earth, yasihu, sayahatan' when he goes thoroughout it. Its root is from
As-Saah, and it is the flowing water spreading upon the face of the earth. It means
leaving the Amsar (civilized lands, or large cities) and settling in the wilderness, and not
attending the Friday prayer and the congregations." (An-Nihãyah)

Since all of the religions is commanding good and forbidding evil, the
Messenger of Allah explained many of its elements with the same levels of
commanding good and forbidding evil; that is, changing the evil into goodness
with the hand if one is able, if not then with the tongue, and if not then in the

of it is commanding good and forbidding evil, and it is required upon every
Muslim, within their ability.

Chapter 19. The Allowance To
Stay Behind Due To An Excuse
2507. Zaid bin Thabit said: "I was
beside the Messenger of Allah
when divinely-inspired tranquility
overtook him. The thigh of the
Messenger of Allah fell down
on my thigh, and I didn't find
anything heavier than the thigh of
the Messenger of Allah . He
then regained his composure and
said: 'Write.' So I wrote down on a
shoulder (blade): 'Not equal are
those of the believers who sit (at
home) among the believers, and
the Mujãhidin in Allah's cause'
until the end of the Verse. Ibn
Umm MaktUm - who was a blind
man - stood up when he heard
the superiority of the Mujahidin,
and said: '0 Messenger of Allah!
What about those believers who
are not able to perform Jihad?' As
soon as he finished asking, divinely
inspired tranquility overtook the
Messenger of Allah . His thigh
fell down on my thigh, and I felt
the heavy weight for the second
time as I had felt it the first time.
Then the Messenger of Allah
regained his composure, and said:
'Read 0 Zaid.' So I read: Not
equal are those of the believers
who sit (at home). The Messenger
of Allah said: Except those who
are disabled' (reciting) the
complete Verse."111Zaid said:
"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,

AbU 'Imrãn, who said: "We went on
a military expedition from AlMadinah headed for
Constantinople, and 'AbdurRahmän bin Khalid bin Al-WalId
was (commander) over the group.
The Romans had gathered before
the wall of the city (ready to fight).
So a man went to attack the enemy.
Thereupon the people said: 'Stop,
stop! None has the right to be
worshiped but Allah! He is throwing
himself into destruction!' Thus AbU
Ayyub said: 'This Verse was
revealed about us, the people of the
Ansãr, when Allah granted victory to
His Prophet and gave Islam
dominance, we said: "Come, let us
stay with our wealth (and
properties) and improve it."
Thereupon, Allah, the Mighty and

When the circumstances behind the revelation of a Verses of the Qur'an are

recipe for self-destruction.
Chapter 23. Regarding
Shooting

Messenger of Allah say: 'Allah,

three people into Paradise by one
arrow: The one made it and seeks
good (in reward) by his making it;
the one who shoots it, and the one
who hands it to him. So shoot and
ride, but your shooting is dearer to
me than your riding. Every kind of
amusement is futile except three: A
man's training his horse, playing
with his wife, and his shooting with
his bow and arrow. A person who
abandons shooting after learning it,
out of an aversion for it, then it is a
favor he has abandoned" or he

Comments:
A martyr is doubtless accorded a special status and rank, but some nonmartyrs also can secure higher ranks by virtue of their unfailing sincerity, piety
and abundant virtuous deeds. It is understood by some of the commentaries,
that in this narration, the mention of the more exalted of deeds is regarding
the second one who died, and that perhaps the Messenger of Allah knew
of his sincerity in his good deeds. It appears that the author considered the
meaning to be the opposite, based upon where he narrated it, that is, that the
second man's deeds were below that of the first. And Allah knows best.

In case of need, a believer is allowed to engage a hireling to perform Jihãd
etc. on his behalf. The reward for his participation in such an expedition shall,
however, depend on the purity of his intention and the degree of his sincerity
in performing the act. If he really means to achieve the pleasure and
closeness to the mercy of Allah through his action, he would get a double
benefit, viz, spoils of war and reward from Allah in the Hereafter.

2537. It was reported from
Muhammad bin 'Amr, from AbU
Salamah, from Abu Hurairah, that
'Amr bin Uqaish had dealt in Ribã
during Jahili)yah, so he did not like
to accept Islam without retrieving
it. He came during the battle of
Uhud and said: "Where are my
paternal cousins?" They replied:
"At Uhud." He said: "Where is soand-so?" They replied: "At Uhud."
He said: "Where is so-and-so?"
They replied: "At Uhud." He then
got dressed in his coat of armor,
mounted his horse and proceeded
towards them. When the Muslims
saw him they said: "Stay away from
us 0 'Amr!" He said: "I have
become a believer." He fought
until he was wounded. He was
carried to his family, injured. Sa'd
bin Mu'ãdh visited him, and said to
his sister: "Ask him, why did he
fight; out of partisanship for his
people, or out of anger for them,
or out of anger of Allah?" He said:
"Out of anger of Allah and His
Messenger." He then died, and
entered Paradise, and he had not
performed a single $a1at for Allah.

explained Al-Jalab (Ma'alam As-Sunan): "This is explained as; that the horse should not
be yelled at during the race, nor goaded by any kind of goading to make it run faster. It
is only required that their riders prod them by moving the bridle and pulling the reins,
and prodding them on with the whip and spurs, and similar to that, without yelling at
them with the voice. And it has been said that its meaning is that people congregate,
lining up, standing along the two sides, and yelling, so they were prohibited from that.
As for Al-Janab, it is said that they would have a horse run alongside, until when they
were near the finish, they would alternate from the mount which had fatigued, mounting
the horse that was not ridden yet. So that was prohibited." In An-Nihayah Ibn Al-Athir
said about Al-Jalab: "It is that a man follows behind his horse encouraging it, yelling and
screaming at it, to goad it to continue, so that was prohibited." And about Al-Janab, he
said similar to Al-Khattãbi.

The rulings and decisions made by the Commanders of the Islamic army (or
the jurists and scholars) are always fraught with the possibility of either being
right or wrong. As such any notion or claim about the infallibility of a
particular judgment or the claim of it being the unquestionable command of
Allah will be absolutely misplaced and wrong.

Chapter 98. Regarding The
Judgment For The Spy When

2650. It was narrated from
'Ubaidullãh bin AN Rãfi', who was a
scribe for 'All bin AN Talib, who
said: "I heard 'All saying: 'The
Messenger of Allah sent myself,
Az-Zubair, and Al-Miqdad, and he
said: "Proceed until you come to the
garden of Khakh where you will find
a woman with a letter, take it from
her." We proceeded racing each
other on our horses until we came to
the garden, where we found the
woman. We said: "Give us the
letter." She said: "I don't have any
letters." I said: "Either you take out
the letter, or we will strip you off
your clothes (to search for the
letter)." He said: 'She took it out
from a braid in her hair. We brought
it to the Prophet J. It was
addressed from Hatib bin AM
Balta'ah to some people from the
idolators, informing them about
some of the affairs of the Messenger
of Allah . He asked: "What is this
O Uatib?" He replied: "0
Messenger of Allah! Do not be hasty
with me, I am a man who was
attached to the Quraish, while I am
not one of them. Whereas those of
the Quraish (emigrants living in AlMadinah), they have a relationship

protection, I wanted to give them

nor of apostasy." The Messenger of
Allah said: "He told you the
truth." 'Umar said: "Give me
permission to strike the neck of this
hypocrite." The Messenger of Allah
said: "He attended (the battle of)

A1-Khattäbi said: "From the Fiqh of this Hadith, is that the judgment
regarding a person who has some kind of interpretation when permitting a
forbidding matter, is different than the judgment upon one who intentionally
makes it lawful, without some kind of interpretation. And it also indicates that
when one is involved in something from the forbidden matters, and he claims
it is due to a matter that is implied by some kind of interpretation, then it is
to be understood in accordance with what he said, even if the dominant
suspicion is contrary to that. Do you not see that when the affair was such
that it implied, and was possible, that the reality was as Uatib said, and it was
also possible that the reality was as 'Umar said, may Allah be pleased with
him; Allah's Messenger employed Husna?-zann (gave him the benefit of
doubt) in his case, and he accepted what he claimed in his saying. And in it, is
the evidence, that when the spy is a Muslim, he is not to be killed. And they
(scholars) differ over what punishment is to be applied to him. So the people
of opinion (A &b Ar-Rai) said; in the case of a Muslim, when he has written
to the enemy and instructed them about the secret affairs of the Muslims, he
is to be inflicted with a (physical) punishment and imprisoned for a long
period. Al-Awzã'i said, if he is a Muslim, then the Imam is to punish him with
a punishment that makes an example of him, and banish him to a remote area
while bound, and if he is a Dhimmi (a non-Muslim with a covenant) then his
covenant is revoked. Malik said: 'I have not heard anything about it, and I
think it is up to the independent judgment of the Imam.' Ash-Shãfi'i said:
'When this occurs with a man of high rank, out of ignorance, as happened
with Hãtib, out of ignorance; and he was not considered to be lying, then I
The Book Of Jihãd 285 3I jI
like that he be left alone. And if he is not a person of high rank, then it is for
the Imam to apply Ta'ztr (punishment) on him.' Also among the Fiqh of the
Hadith, is the allowance of looking at what is exposed of women in
establishing a punishment, or establishing testimony affirming a right, and
what resembles that of matters. And in it, is evidence that whoever alleges
Kufr or Nifaq about a Muslim via some interpretation, and he is among the
people of Ijtihad, then punishment is not warranted for him. Do you not see
that 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: 'Give me permission to
strike the neck of this hypocrite' while he was a believer, for whom Allah's
Messenger attested to what he claimed about that, then, he was not harsh
with 'Umar for what he had said. And that was because, 'Umar was not acting
out of hostility in this saying, which was based on the apparent judgment of
the religion; since the hypocrite is the one who manifests aid to the religion in
the open, and internally aids the disbelievers, and in this incident, what Hãtib
did, resembled what the hypocrites do. Except that Allah's Messenger ;
informed that Allah, Most High, had pardoned him for what he did in that
incident, and so he (also) pardoned him, so the application of hypocrisy
ceased being applicable in his case. And Allah knows best."

Al-Ghairah is a sense of honor and jealousy regarding one's women-folk. AlGhairah in matters of doubt would be like when a man sees a person of no
close blood relation with his wife or daughter, etc. An example of when there
is no doubt would be when someone wants to many his sister or widowed (or
divorced) mother in a legal way, then he should not be over protective of her
if the one who proposed has good conduct and is religious.

took refuge on a hillock. They said:
'Come down and surrender

not descend into the protection of

'This is their first act of treachery,
by Allah! I am not going to
accompany you people. In them
(my companions who died) I take
my example.' They dragged him,
but he refused to go with them, so
they killed him. Khubaib stayed as
their captive, until they finally
agreed to kill him. He asked for a
razor to shave his pubes. When
they took him outside to kill him,
he said to them: 'Let me pray two
Rak'ah.' Then he said: 'By Allah! If
it was not that you people might
think that I was afraid I would have
increased (the length of prayer)."

loudly: 'We will have his share of

with us?' I said: 'Yes.' He replied:
'Then proceed on the journey, with
the blessings of Allah, the Exalted.'
So I went with good
companionship until Allah granted
us (spoils), and I was given young
female camels as my share of the
spoils. I drove them till I reached

of the saddles of his camel, and
said: 'Drive them backwards.'

Meaning those disbelievers who are captured and chained by the Muslim
military, but then they later accept Islam, as a result of which they are
admitted to Paradise. We can deduce from the contents of the Hadith that
chaining captives is permissible in war. The Hadith has also been interpreted
to refer to those Muslims that are taken captive and chained, then either die
or are assassinated in captivity.

she leapt up. He turned aside from
them until he came to the farthest

Prophet . Whenever he spoke a
word to him, he took hold of his
beard while Al-Mughirah bin

Prophet with a sword, wearing a
helmet. He hit his ('Urwah's) hand
with the lower end of his sheath

wealth of treachery, we have no
need of it." He mentioned the -Iadith. - "So the Prophet said:
'Write down: This is what

Muhammad, the Messenger of
Allah has decided." - And he
mentioned the story. - "Then
Suhail said: 'If any man from
among us comes to you, even if he
follows your religion, you should
return him back to us.' When the
document was concluded the
Prophet said to his
Companions: 'Get up, sacrifice and
then shave (your heads).'
Thereafter, some believing women
came emigrating, (he mentioned
the) Verse.

sending them back, and he ordered
the dowry to be returned to their
husbands. Then he returned back
to Al-Madinah. AbU Basir - a
man from the Quraish (who was a
Muslim) - came to him. They (the
Quraish) sent (two men) looking
for him. He handed him to the two
men. They took him away, and
when they reached Dhul-Uulaifah
they dismounted to eat from the
dates they had. AbU BaIr said to
one of the two men: 'By Allah!
What an excellent sword you have!'
The other one drew the sword and
said: 'Yes I have tried it.' AbU
Basir said: 'Let me see it.' He gave
it to him, and he struck him with it
until he died. The other man fled
away until he entered Al-Madinah,
and entered the Masjid running.
The Prophet said: 'He has seen
something frightening.' He said:
'By Allah! My companion has been
killed and I am very close to being
killed.' Then AbU Basir arrived,

using a spear to cut in the hollow of its throat near the breastbone, this
process may also be used for other large and dangerous animals like the cow
for example.

Musinnah, in reference to cows, is the one that has lived for more than two
years, entering into its third, in the case of sheep, it is the one that has
completed one year, and entered into its second. Jadh'ah is the animal that
does not have any teeth growing in place of earlier teeth. For goats it refers
to one that has lived for one year. For sheep it is between six months and one
year, and there are different views about that from the scholars.
2798. It was reported from Zaid
bin Khälid Al-Juhani, he said: "The
Messenger of Allah divided
some sacrificial animals among his

2823. 'Ata' bin Yasãr narrated
from a man from Banü Harithah;
"While he was grazing a Liqezah in
one of the mountain passes of
Uhud, he saw that it was about to
die. He could not find anything to
slaughter the animal with. He took
a stake and stabbed it in the upper
part of the breast till the blood
gushed out. Then he came to the
Prophet and informed him
about it. He told him to eat it."
(Sahih)
2824. It was reported from 'Ad!
bin Hãtim who said: "I said: '0
Messenger of Allah! What if one of
us catches some game and he does
not have a knife, can he slaughter
it with a Manvah and a splinter of a
staff?' He said: 'Cause the blood to

Comments:
As proved from the previous Ahadith, it is not allowed in Islam to slaughter
an animal with human teeth or fingernails. Barring these two methods, the
animal slaughtered in Allah's Name with any sharp device would be legitimate
and permitted to eat.

'Aishah, who said - and Hammad
and Malik (two of the narrators)
did not mention: "from 'Aishah"
- that they (the people) said: "0

It is unlawful to deliberately omit pronouncing Allah's Name at the time of

should be no doubt about the legality and permissibility of such slaughter.

(Hasan)
Abu Dawud said: Some of them
said that Fara' is the firstborn to
the camel, which they used to
sacrifice for their false deities, and
then eat it, and its skin was thrown
on a tree; and the 'Atirah was
(sacrificed) during the first ten days
of Rajab.
Jt L jLiit -L. t [otj]
Comments:
The popular view is that the Fara' and 'Atirah were allowed, then later
prohibited. It is reported from Imãm Ash-Shãfi'i, and some of the Salaf
before him, that they considered it recommended or did it, and Shaikh AlAlbãni endorses its allowance in h-wa' Al-Ghalil (no. 1181) as did Imam AshShawkãni in Nail Al-A wEar. Shaikh AI-Albãni said: "These Ahad(th imply the
allowance of Al-Fara', and it is to slaughter the firstborn (animal) for the sake
of Allah; and (they imply) the allowance of the slaughter in Rajab and other
than it, without distinguishing and specifying Rajab over other months. There
is no contradiction between that and the preceding Ijadith: 'There is no Fara'
and no 'Atirah' because in that, he ç only invalidated the Fara' which the
people of Jahiliyyah performed for their idols, and the 'Atirah which is the
animal that they slaughtered specifically for Rajab. And Allah knows best."
Chapter 20,21. The 'Aqiqah
2834. It was reported from
Habibah bint Maisarah, from Umm
Kurz Al-Ka'biyyah who said: "I
heard the Messenger of Allah ç
saying: 'For a boy; two sheep that
are Mukafi'atan, and for a girl one
sheep." (azii)

saying: "Mukfi'atan means: Both -1 : J

Comments:
The animal slaughtered on behalf of a new baby is called 'Aqiqah. Lexically,
the word means: to cleave, to split. The term is also applied to the hair of the
newborn, and it is for this reason that this particular slaughter is also known
as Aqtqah.

A1-Khattãbi cites an explanation of Imam Ash-Shafl'i; that if Arabs set out from their
house on some matter, and they saw a bird flying, they would derive an omen from the
direction of flight. If the bird was sitting on its perch, they would startle it so it would
fly, so they could determine the omen. Al-Khattãbi also added, that it has been said that
the Hadith shows that it is disliked to hunt birds during the night, meaning, that they
should not be hunted while they are nesting.
The Book Of Sacrifices 399
Comments:
What Imãm AbU Dãwud means to say is that the words "from his father"
occurring after 'Abdulläh, in the previous narration from Sufyan, are wrongly
inserted in the chain of narrators.
2837. It was reported from
Hammam who said: "Qatadah
narrated to us, from Al-I-Iasan,
from Samurah, from the Messenger
of Allah , that he said: 'Each boy
is in mortgage by his 'Aqiqah,
which is sacrificed on the seventh
day, his head shaved and bloodied
(Yudamma)."
When Qatadah was asked about
the blood, and what to do with it,
he said: "When you slaughter the
Aqiqah take some of its wool, and
place it on its veins, then place it in
the middle of the head of the
infant so that the blood flows on
the hair like a thread, and then his
(the infants) head is washed and
shaved." (Pali)
Abü DAwud said: This is a mistake
from Hammãm: "Yudamma."
Abu Dãwud said: Hammam has
been opposed (by other narrators)
in narrating this word, and it is an
error from Hammãm. They only
said: "Yusamma" (named) but
Hammãm said: "Yudamma"
(bloodied).
AbU Dawud said: And this is not
adhered too.

AI-Khattabi said: "Almad said: 'This is regarding intercession' meaning, if
there was no 'Aqiqah for him and the child dies, he will not intercede for his

used to emphasize the necessity and the obligatory nature of the 'Aqiqah.

On reaching the age of puberty, the child ceases to be legally an "orphan,"
and therefore should be responsible for his own affairs. Thus, if he is found to

matters relating to business and marriage arrangements. But if it is found that
the orphan has not developed the capacity of sound judgment, the guardian
shall, for some additional time, remain in-charge of his affairs.
As regards the vow of silence, people were wont to observing it in the preIslamic era. When Islam came, it was prohibited. Instead, it was encouraged
for the people to use their gift of speech to articulate the praises of Allah and
speak other good things.

Comments:
The standard definition of Waqf (endowment or trust), is something or some
property that is kept in tact, and the income accrued from it is given in
charity. In all cases of Waqf, the conditions imposed on the property as well
as on the administrator have to be clearly stipulated.
A person allotting a high-yielding property as a Waqf, so that even after his
death, the expenditures concerned continue to benefit by it, is an act of great
virtue, since Allah says in the Qur'an: "By no means shall you attain
righteousness (and reward from Allah) unless you spend (in His cause) of that
which you love." (Al 'Imran 3:92)
The administrator of the trust has the right to spend, within the accepted
norms for himself in his work for the Waqf, and his guests, from its income.
The will, as well as the trust deed, must be in the form of a written document,
with signatures of witnesses affixed to it, so as to obviate the possibility of
misappropriation and waste in it.

Comments:
The reply given by 'Abdullãh bin Mas'Ud is based on what is known as the
Verse of Inheritance that reads: If (there are) women (only daughters), two or
more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance (An-Nisã' 4:11). Thus, once
a single daughter has been given one-half of the inheritance, what the
granddaughter gets is only one-sixth of the share. They will thus both
complete the share meant for two daughters.

The Messenger of Allah replied:

Sisters co-existing with daughters (i.e. by the joining of real or consanguine
sisters with daughters or granddaughters), become 'residuary' ('Acabah)
together with the daughters. If a single daughter or sister is the legatee (heir),
she gets one-half of the inheritance. The daughter gets half of the asset as her
prescribed share, while the sister of the deceased gets it as an 'Acabah. If the
number of the daughters is two or more, who get two-thirds of inheritance,
the sister (or sisters) get (or share) the remaining one-third of the property.

Bakr said: 'Do you have anybody

Muhammad bin Maslamah stood

AbU Bakr implemented it for her.
Then another grandmother came

about her inheritance. He said:
'There is nothing prescribed for

the freed slave (as well). Al-Wald' refers to the relationship between them
after the freeing of the slave. The relationship is immutable that can neither
be changed or gifted nor bought or sold, and due to this relationship, the one
freed takes on the tribal affinity of the one who freed him, and the one who
freed him is his heir.

Comments:
AN Hanifah and Ishaq hold the view that the one who accepts Islam may
agree to Wald' with the one by whom he accepted it. Others explain that the
narration does not clearly state that they inherit from each other, and they
cite the 1-ladith: "The Wald' is for the one who freed." Meaning, in the case
where a slave accepted Islam at the hands of this man, and another man paid
to have him freed, then which of the two has the Wald', so this narration
explains that the Wald' is for the one who freed.
Chapter 14. Regarding Selling

Comments:
The Messenger of Allah had established the relationship of brotherhood
between individuals among the Ansãr and Muhajirin. It was on the basis of
this pledge of brotherhood that the two parties became heirs of each other,
superseding the relationships based on genealogy and adoption. Another
customary way of mutual inheritance prevailing in pre-Islamic Arabia was
through tribal alliances that bound the individuals, as well as the tribes to help
each other in all exigencies. The custom continued for a time early in Islam.
Allah abolished all such relationships once and for all by aportioning the
shares of inheritors in the Qur'an. However, the obligation to help each other
on moral grounds and for the sake of Islamic brotherhood, or for purposes of
implementing the lawful will of a person, if any, is still in force in Islam.

There is not a single affair of man that can go in his favor without Allah's

Comments:
The Messenger of Allah and the Caliphs that followed him, had adopted
various methods for the management and representation of different sections
of the society. Sometimes, the responsibility of educating the new Muslims on
religious lines was entrusted to these representatives. At times,
representatives or chiefs of the previous dispensations were retained on their
posts with new directives. At other times, people from groups already trained
were either deputed for the purpose, or they were sent just to train the new
entrants to Islam, and came back after doing their task.
2934. It was reported from Ghalib
Al-Qattan, from a man, from his
father, from his grandfather, that
they were staying at one of the
springs. When the Message of
Islam reached them, the owner of
the spring told his people that he
will give them one hundred camels
if they accept Islam. They accepted
Islam, and he divided the camels
between them. Then it occurred to
him to take his camels back from
them. He sent his son to the
Prophet and instructed him:
"Go to the Prophet and say to
him: 'My father is sending his
Salãm to you. He had allocated
one hundred camels for his people
if they accepted Islam. They

accepted Islam, so he divided the
camels among them. Now it
occurred to him that he wants his
camels back. Is he more entitled to
them or are they?' If he says to
you: 'Yes,' or 'No,' say to him: 'My
father is an old man and he is the
'Arif of the water, and he is
requesting you (the son) to make
the 'Arif after him.' He came to
him and said: 'My father is sending
his Salam to you.' He replied:
"May peace be upon you and your
father.' He said: 'My father had
allocated one hundred camels for
his people if they accept Islam.
They became Muslims, and made
their Islam good (being steadfast
on Islam). Now it occurred to him
that he wants his camels back. Is he
more entitled to them or are they?'
He said: 'If he likes to give it to
them he may do so, and if he likes
to take it back then he is more
entitled to it than his people. If
they accept Islam then for them is
Islam, but if they do not accept
Islam, then they will be fought for
Islam.' He said: 'My father is an
old man, and he is the 'Arif of the
water, and he is requesting you to
make me the 'Arif after him.' He
replied: 'The role of the 'Arif is
important, and people must have
'Arifs, but the 'Artf are in the
Fire." (DaiJ)

of Allah and say to him: '0

anything with which to pay the

the other employees give you and
we will benefit from it as well."
'All bin Abi Talib came while we

telling us not to be hasty, and that

permissible for Muhammad or the

said: 'Hamzah bin 'AbdulMuttalib.' He is in this house
drinking with some of the Ana-r,
with a singing-girl, singing for him
and his companions. She said in
her song: "0 Hamzah, go and deal
with these fat she-camels," and he
rushed to his sword and cut off
their humps, slashed their flanks
and removed their livers." 'All

Messenger of Allah realized
from my expression that something
had happened to me, and the

Hamzah was. He asked for

permission was given to him, and

rebuke Hamzah for what he had

In the matter of providing financial assistance, the Prophet , gave priority to

Allah. As for his own kinsmen, he liked them to lead a frugal life and be
content with the little that they had, and to remember Allah often and express
2988. It was narrated from AbU AlWard, that Ibn A'bud said: " 'All
said to me: 'Shall I not tell you
about me and Fatimah, the
daughter of the Messenger of Allah

family to him?' I said: 'Yes.' He
said: 'She turned the grindstone
until it left marks on her hands, and
she carried water in a water skin

her garment got dusty. Some slaves
were brought to the Prophet ,
and I said: "Why don't you go to
your father and ask him for a
slave?" She went to him, but she
found some people with him,
talking to him, so she came back.
The next day he came to her, and
said: "What did you want?" but she
remained quiet. I said: "I will tell
you, 0 Messenger of Allah. She
turned the grindstone until it left
marks on her hands, and she carried
water in a water skin until it left

cannot do you more harm than the

Since no armed conflict or fighting took place with Banu An-Nadir, but just a
siege by the Muslims, and the Jews agreed to vacate the city without a fight,
the movable and immovable properties left behind by them fell under the

the Prophet (). The Messenger Allah utilized the Fai' proceeds for the help

Comments:
As-Sawäd is a name which was used for a very large portion of Al-'Iraq which
was frequented by date-palms and farms, the exact limits of the area that the
name was applied to differed over time. This Hadith is a Prophetic prophecy.
The first part of it, contains the glad tiding that these areas shall be
conquered, and spoils and tributes shall accrue from them. Thereafter there
shall come a time when the inhabitants of the area shall withhold their
payments, either through their blank refusal to pay, or because they will
accept Islam, thus removing themselves from paying the Jizyah, 'Ushur or
other than that, or because they will rebel after entering Islam. A number of
the earlier commentaries, like that of Imam An-Nawawi, mention that these
things had occurred by his time, with the people of those lands accepting
Islam, which according to their view at that time, indicates that the truth of
the Hadith had already come to light by their time.

Chapter 29,30. Regarding
Levying The Jizyah
3037. It was narrated from Anas
bin Malik and 'Uthman bin AN
Sulaiman that the Prophet sent
Khalid bin Al-Walid to Ukaidir
(the ruler) of DUmah. They seized
him and brought him (to the
Prophet), who granted him
protection and concluded a treaty
with him on the basis that he would
pay the Jizyah. (Da'iJ)

Comments:
Jizyah is a tax collected from people of the Book and Zoroastrians, when
Muslims conquer their land by war or treaty.
3038. It was narrated from
Mu'ãdh, that when the Prophet
sent him to Yemen, he ordered
him to take, from everyone who
had reached the age of puberty, a
Dinãr, or its equivalent in the
Ma'afiri garments that were to be
found in Yemen. (Da'J)

day, I performed Wuçlu' and stood
up to call the Adhan for the prayer,
and I saw that the idolator had
come with a group of merchants.
When he saw me he said: "0
Ethiopian!" I said: "Here I am."
He frowned at me, and spoke
harshly to me, and said to me: "Do
you know how many days are left
until the end of the month?" I said:
"A few." He said: "There are only
four, then I shall take you back
(into slavery) in return for what
you owe me, and you will go back
to tending sheep as you did
before." I got distressed, as anyone
would in such a situation. I prayed
Al-'Atamah ('Isha') and the
Messenger of Allah went back
to his family, then I asked for
permission to enter upon him, and
he gave me permission. I said: "0
Messenger of Allah, may my father

The idolater from whom I used to

anything with which to pay him,

permission to run away to one of

Islam, until Allah provides His
Messenger with something with
which he can pay it off on my

put my sword, water-skin, shoes

leave as soon as dawn broke. But a
man came running and said: "0

there were four camels kneeling
with their loads on their backs. I
asked permission to enter, and the
Messenger of Allah ii said to me:
"Be of good cheer, for Allah has
send something with which to pay
off your debt." Then he said: "Do
you not see these four camels
kneeling?" I said: "Yes." He said:
"They and their loads are for you;
they are carrying clothing and food
that was given to me by the ruler of
Fadak; take them, and pay off your
debt." So I did that. Then I went to
the Masjid and saw the Messenger
of Allah sitting in the Masjid. I
greeted him with Salam and he
said: "How was the wealth you had
(i.e., was it enough to pay off the
debt)?" I said: "Allah, Exacted is
He, has paid off everything that
was due from the Messenger of
Allah , and there is nothing left
to pay." He said: "Is there anything
left over?" I said: "Yes." He said:
"See if you can relieve me of it, for
I will not enter upon any of my
family until you relieve me of it."
When the Messenger of Allah i

me; no one has come to me." The

others they shall become the source of the raising of their ranks in the

It is a desirable act that the family, friends, and relatives of the deceased
gather and sit together on this occasion. There is no requirement, however,
that they sit only on the ground. They may sit on mats, cots, chairs and the
like. To consider it something like a compulsory ritual to sit in waiting to
receive condolences from the people for three days is improper; there is no
injunction for this in the Shari'ah.

The Ijadith seems to suggest that it is unlawful for women to visit the

Comments:
1. The tradition is weak. Yet, the correct position in the light of other sound
Ahadith is that we are prohibited even to listen to other people's bewailing,
loud lamentation and mourning over the dead.
2. The Arabic term Niy&fiah or Nuwaz means lamenting and wailing loudly for
the dead, or indulging in acts like pulling one's hair, throwing dust over one's
head or tearing at one's clothes, and so on. As for the crying itself, there is
nothing blameworthy about it.
3129. It was narrated from 'Urwah, -
from his father, from Ibn 'Umar - -
The Book Of Funerals 573 j'31
that he said: "The Messenger of
Allah said: 'The deceased is
tormented because of his family's
weeping for him." That was
mentioned to 'Aishah and she said:
"Do you mean Ibn 'Umar narrated
that? All that happened is that the
Prophet passed by a grave and
said: 'The occupant of this (grave)
is being tormented and his family is
weeping for him." Then she
recited: 'And no bearer of burdens
shall bear another's burden.'[']He
(the author said) - from Abü
Mu'awiyah (in his narration): "(He
passed) by the grave of a Jew."

A\
6 rSV4.:
Comments:
If the deceased person is a disbeliever, or even the sort of Muslim that has
left a will for the family to wail for him after his death, he will be punished
for the act. Punishing under these circumstances does not go against the
meaning of the quoted Verse. In case he disliked any such act and had
commanded his people not to do it, but they did it anyway, the deceased
person will be exempt from all blame and punishment.
3130. It was narrated that YazId

Deceased Is To Be Washed
3142. It was narrated from
Muhammad bin Shin, from Umm
'Atiyyah, that she said: "The
Messenger of Allah entered
upon us when his daughter died
and said: 'Wash her three or five
times, or more than that, if you see
fit, with water and lote leaves, and
put camphor (in the water) the last
time, or a little camphor. And
when you have finished, call me.'
When we had finished, we called
him, and he gave us his Ilaqwa and
said: Put it next to her body."
(Sahih)
(AbU Dawud) said: Malik said:
"Meaning his Izãr"' 1 and Musaddad did not say: "entered upon us."

Comments:
1. It is a Sunnah to wash the deceased person at least thrice. If considered
necessary, he may even be washed five times or more.
2. It is preferable to put some leaves of a lote tree while boiling the water for
washing the dead. It is, likewise, desirable to put some camphor in the water
in the last phase of washing.

There is a difference of opinion concerning the funeral prayer for the
miscarrired fetus. ImAm Ahmad bin Uanbal and Isiaq bin Ibrãhim hold the
view that if the fetus is older than four months and ten days, and soul has
been breathed into it, it is necessary to perform the funeral prayer for it. Ibn

the funeral prayer must be held for it.

He said: 'How do you know?' He

not died.' So he went back, but a

came to the Messenger of Allah

Prophet said: 'He has not died.'
He went back, and a cry was raised
for him, and his wife said: 'Go to
the Messenger of Allah and tell
him.' The man said: '0 Allah, curse
him.' Then the man went and saw
that he had killed himself with an
arrowhead that he had with him.
He went to the Prophet , and
told him that he had died. He said:
'How do you know?' He said: 'I
saw him killing himself with an

He said: 'Did you (really) see

from the sun. I said: 'Who is this

Anas bin Malik.'
When the Janazah was placed on
the ground, Anas stood and offered
the funeral prayer for (the
deceased), and I was behind him

him. He stood by his head, and
said the Takbtr four times, and he
did not make (the prayer) long or
nor in a hurry. Then he went and
sat down. They said: '0 AbU
Hamzah, the Ansãri woman.' They
brought her near, and she was
covered with a green bier. He
stood in line with her buttocks and
offered the funeral prayer for her,
as he had done for the man, then
he sat down. Al-'Alã' bin Ziyd
said: '0 AbU Hamzah, did the
Messenger of Allah 44 offer the
funeral prayer as you did, with four
Takbir, and standing by the head of
a man, and by the buttocks of a

He said: '0 AbU Hamzah, did you
go out on a campaign with the
Messenger of Allah (a)?' He said:
'Yes, I went out on the campaign
with him to Hunain, and the
idolaters came out and attacked us
(so fiercely) that we fled faster
than our horses. Among the
people, there was a man who was
attacking us, smashing us and
wounding us. But Allah defeated
them, and they were brought and
started giving him (the Prophet )
their pledge for Islam. One of the
Companions of the Prophet
said: 'I take a vow, that if Allah
brings me the man who was
smashing us all day, I shall strike

Abu Ghalib said: "I asked about

There is no difference between funeral prayers for a man and woman except

it in 53 AH during the time of Mu'awiyah.
3220. It was narrated that AlQasim said: "I entered upon
'Aishah and said: '0 mother, show
me the grave of the Messenger of
Allah , and his two Companions,
may Allah be pleased with them.'
She showed me three graves which
were neither high nor low, covered

Comments:
Putting an inscription on the grave containing the deceased person's name
and lineage or words of praise for him, or writing the names of Allah or His
Messenger jLhi,, or Verses from the Qur'an, all this is prohibited in Islam.
Nevertheless, putting up some sort of a marker, like what the Allah's
Messenger did when he put a stone on the grave of 'Uthman bin MaThn,
is permissible.
3227. It was narrated from Abfl c> L s'- U.A -

Comments:
It is unlawful to perform Salat either facing the grave or inside the graveyard.

As proven from this Hadith, it is better for anyone walking among the graves
to take off his shoes. There must be separate graveyards for Muslims and
non-Muslims.

Chapter 75, 77. Visiting Graves
3234. It was narrated that AbU
Hurairah said: "The Messenger of
Allah came to the grave of his
mother and wept, and those who
were around him also wept. Then
the Messenger of Allah () said:
'I asked my Lord, Exalted is He,
for permission to pray for
forgiveness for her, but He did not
give me permission. Then I asked
for permission to visit her grave,
and He gave me permission. So
visit graves, for they remind one of
death." (Sahih)
Comments:
A visit to the graves makes man remember the transient nature of the world
and of the certainty of the Hereafter, and it also imparts tenderness to the
heart.
3235. It was narrated from Ibn
Buraidah that his father said: "The

Comments:
Thene is no restrietion on women visiting the graves provided they abide by
the code of Islamic dress and conduct, as can be deduced from the aforesaid
Ahadith that give blanket permission to Muslims to visit the graves. However,
if women violate the Islamic morals, make loud lamentations, prostrate
themselves before the graves or hoist lamps over them, they invite the curse
of Allah. All such activities must be avoided, and those women who persist in
such activities are not allowed to visit the graves.
Chapter 77, 79. What To Say
When Passing Graves
3237. It was narrated from AbU
Hurairah that the Messenger of
Allah went out to the graveyard
and said: "As-salamu 'alaikum dara

Chapter 78, 80. What Should
Be Done With The Muhrim If
He Dies?
3238. It was narrated from 'Amr

from Ibn 'Abbas who said: "A
man's she-camel had thrown him,
and his neck was broken, and he

died while he was in Ihram; he was
brought to the Prophet . He
said: 'Shroud him in his two
garments and wash him with water
and lote leaves, but do not cover
his head, for Allah will raise him
on the Day of Resurrection reciting
the Talbiyah." (ahiz)
AbU Dawud said: I heard Ahmad
bin Uanbal say: "There are five
Sunnahs in this Hadith: 'Shroud
him in his two garments,' meaning,
the deceased should be shrouded
in two cloths; 'wash him with water
and lote leaves," meaning, there
should be lote leaves in every
washing; 'do not cover his head
and do not bring any perfume near
him.' And the shroud is from his
own wealth.

3239. It was narrated from 'Amr
and Ayyüb, from Sa'eed bin Jubair,
from Ibn 'Abbas, similarly (as in
no. 3238). He said: "And shroud
him in two garments." (aziz)
AbU Dãwud said: Sulaimãn (one of
the narrators) said: "AyyUb said:
'His two garments." 'Amr said:
'Two garments." Ibn 'Ubaid said:
"AyyUb said: 'In two garments.'
'Amr said: 'In his two garments."
Sulaiman alone added: "And do
not put any perfume on him."
The Book Of Funerals 626
3240. (Another chain) from AyyUb,
from Sa'eed bin Jubair, from Ibn
'Abbas, with similar to the meaning
narrated by Sulaiman (no. 3239):
"In two garments." (Saiih)
3241. It was reported from AlHakam, from Sa'eed bin Jubair,
from Ibn 'Abbas who said: "A man
in I/warn was thrown by his shecamel and was killed. He was
brought to the Messenger of Allah
, and he said: 'Wash him and
shroud him, but do not cover his
head, nor bring any perfume near
him, for he will be raised reciting
the Talbiyah."

21. THE BOOK OF
OATHS AND VOWS
Oath: Swearing an oath (Halif) means to strengthen one's claim or statement
by mentioning Allah's Name or His attributes. And since the Arabs also
shook hands on the occasion, the oath is also known as Yamin (literally,
right hand).
Vow: (Nadhr): Means to make a promise for good or for bad. Technically, it
implies to make something binding upon oneself in order to seek closeness to
Allah.
Chapter 1. Stern Warning
Against False Oaths
3242. It was narrated that 'Imrãn
bin Husain said: "The Prophet i
said: 'Whoever swears a binding
oath falsely, let him take his place
on his face in Hell." (Sahih)

Comments:
Lying in itself is a major sin and an accursed practice. It becomes all the more
despicable if a man tells a lie in an oath.
Chapter ( ... ) One Who Swears
An Oath In Order To Usurp
The Wealth Of Another

'Whoever swears an oath in which
he is lying, in order to usurp the

Him." Al-Ash'ath said:[']"That

There was a dispute concerning
some land between myself and a
Jewish man, but he denied it, so I
brought him to the Prophet and
the Prophet said to me: 'Do you
have any proof?' I said: 'No.' He
said to the Jew: 'Swear an oath.' I
said: '0 Messenger of Allah, then
he will swear an oath and take
away my property.' Then Allah,
Most High, revealed: Verily, those
who purchase a small gain at the
cost of Allah's Covenant and their
oaths, ..." until the end of the

from Al-Ash'ath bin Qais, that a
man from Kindah and a man from
Uaciramawt referred a dispute to
the Prophet 40, concerning some
land in Yemen. The Hadrami man
said: "0 Messenger of Allah, my
land was usurped by the father of
this man, and (now) it is in his
possession." He said: "Do you have
any proof?" He said: "No, but
make him swear an oath by Allah

land usurped by his father." The
Kiridi man prepared to swear an
oath, but the Messenger of Allah
said: "No one usurps property
by means of swearing, but he will

Allah." The Kindi man said: "It is

said: "It is my land, and is in my
possession, and I cultivate it; he has
no right to it." The Prophet said
to the Haçlrami man: "Do you have
proof?" He said: "No." He said:
"Then you have to accept his oath."
He said: "0 Messenger of Allah, he
is an evildoer; he does not care
about an oath and he would not stop
at anything." The Prophet said:
"You have no other choice (than to
accept his oath)." So he went and
swore an oath, and when he left, the
Messenger of Allah said: "If he
swore an oath in order to consume
wealth unjustly, then when he meets
Allah, Allah will turn away from
him." (Sahih)
Ajdham: Mutilated, or having the hand chopped off, and they say it may refer to his
claim being cut off.

Comments:
An Islamic judge will only decide the case according to the principles of the
Shari'ah that require the plaintiff to produce a witness, or the respondent to
take an oath. Whatever the religious persuasion of the defendant, he will be
asked to state an oath that shall be accepted.

Shaikh Al-Albani considers the expression Wa abihi (literally, by his father) to
be an interpolation, grading it Shadhdh (irregular) and weak with that
wording. Other scholars have suggested that the words are an expression
habitually introduced into the speech, not intended to make it into an oath.
Some of the scholars have also suggested that in fact the word Rabb (Lord) is
understood before Wa abihi, which will give it the meaning: By the Lord of his
father, and still others said that perhaps this was before it was clearly
prohibited.

Imam At-Tirmidhi (no. 1543) said: "The people of knowledge differed about
this: When a man swears by a religion other than Islam, saying he is a Jew or
a Christian if he were to do this or that. Then he does that thing. Some of
them said that he has committed an atrocity and there is no expiation due
from him. This is the view of the people of Al-Madinah and it is the saying of
Malik bin Anas, and AbU 'TJbaid followed this view. Some of the people of
knowledge among the Companions of the Prophet , the Tãbiin, as well as
others, said that he has to expiate for that. This is the view of Sufyan, Ahmad
and Ishaq." Ibn Al-Mundhir said that: "it will be as he said" means he is a liar
for saying this, just like the enormity of the falsehood of that religion he
swore by. See 'Awn Al-Ma 'bud.

Allah has ordered fulfilling vows in the Qur'an, and the Ahãdtth such as this
condemn making vows. Scholars have debated at length about this matter.
However, the safest view is that fulfilling a vow to obedience is required if
one has made such a vow, and the rule is not making a vow. It is similar to
debt, fulfilling debts is encouraged in the religion, while getting into debt is
not.

was one of those who used to

captured and brought to the

have gained every success." - AbU
Dáwud said: Then I went back to
the Hadith of Sulaimãn - "He said:
'0 Muhammad, I am hungry so
feed me, and I am thirsty so give
me something to drink.' The
Prophet said: 'This is what you
need,' or he said: 'This is what he
needs.' Then the man was
ransomed in return for the two
men, but the Messenger of Allah
jLiigkept Al-Açlba' as his mount.
Then the idolaters raided the flocks
of A1-Madinah and took Al-Adba'.
They took her and captured a
Muslim woman. When night came,
they left the camels in front of
their houses. They were caused to
sleep one night, and the woman got
up, and every time she put her
hand on a camel it groaned, until
she came to Al-Adbã'. She came to
a she-camel that was docile and
well trained, so she rode it and
vowed to Allah that if Allah saved
her, she would sacrifice it. When
she came to A1-Madinah, the camel
was recognised as the camel of the
Prophet , and the Prophet
was told about that. He sent for
her, and she was brought, and he
was told of her vow. He said:
"What a bad reward she has given
it - if Allah saved her by it she
would sacrifice it! There is no
fulfillment of a vow if it involves
disobedience towards Allah, or that
which the son of Adam does not
possess." (Sazih)
Abu Däwud said: This woman was
the wife of AbU Dharr.

Comments:
In this case, since the lady was not the owner of the she-camel, her vow was
declared void.

Messenger of Allah ii besieged the fort of Banü Quraiah - an ally of the
tribe of Aws - they consulted AbU Lubabah as to whether or not to agree to
the arbitration of Sa'd bin Mu'ãdh. AbU Lubãbah drew his hand across his
throat signifying that Sa'd would put them to death. However, he had no
sooner done this than he realized that he had betrayed the trust of the
Prophet He, therefore, went straight to the Masjid and tied himself to one
of its pillars, and swore an oath not to untie himself until Allah forgave him.
At last, after seven days, Allah accepted his repentance and forgave him.

3328. It was narrated from
Muhammad bin 'Amr, meaning Ibn
Abi 'Amr, from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn
'Abbas that a man demanded
repayment from a man who owed
him ten Dinars and he said: "By
Allah, I shall not leave you alone
until you pay me, or bring someone
as a guarantor." He said: "The
Prophet guaranteed it, and he
brought him what he had promised
him. The Prophet said to him:
'From where did you get this gold?'
He said: 'From a mine.' He said:
'We have no need of it; there is
nothing good in it.' And the
Messenger of Allah paid it on
his behalf." (Hasan)
• iL- ;iL
Comments:
Al-Khattãbi has explained that the reason for discouraging the payment with
gold from the mine is not clear, since mining is not by itself discouraged or
unlawful. He stated that the possible reasons include; it may have been a case
wherein the owner of the mine sells some of its area to be worked by
someone, and he gets whatever he can find in that area, and this is a kind of
sale of ambiguity, because the buyer does not know what he will get of ore.
And he mentioned that most of the early A 'immah disapproved of selling
areas of mines. And it could be that because raw gold was not of much use to
them, whereas it was coined Dinars that he owed, and there was no one to
make Dinars with that gold, because most of the Dinars came from the lands
of Rome, and it was not until the time of 'Abdul-Malik bin Marwãn that the
Muslims were coining Dinars. And it is possible that there was some other
ambiguity in the sale of that ore to that man. In his commentary on Sunan
Ibn Majah, As-Sindi said that perhaps it was because the Khumus had not
been taken from that gold, but there is a difference of opinion regarding the
The Book Of Business 61 J
distinction between Rikãz, or buried treasure, and mines; meaning, are they
the same in that the Khumus is paid for both, or just for Rikaz and not for
mines, and this latter saying is the more common view.

hands and ate. Our fathers saw the
Messenger of Allah 40, chewing a
morsel in his mouth, then he said:
'Is it not the meat of a sheep that
was taken without its owners'
permission.' The woman sent word
saying: '0 Messenger of Allah, I
sent (someone) to Al-Baqi' to buy
a sheep for me, but I could not
find one. So I sent word to a
neighbor of mine who had bought
a sheep, (saying) to send it to me
in return for its price, but he could
not be found. So I sent word to his
wife, and she sent it to me.' The
Messenger of Allah said: 'Feed
it to the captives." (ahiez)
1/o: -1 ojJ
Comments:
Since it was implied that the wife had sold the sheep without her husband's
permission, then it appeared that the sheep that was purchased by the host
was sold to her without the permission of its rightful owner, the seller's
husband. And since it had already been slaughtered and prepared - and it
being unlawfully sold was only realized or learned about after it was
purchased and prepared - then it was given as charity in a lawful category for
expenditure of Zakat, that being prisoners of war - who were non-Muslims -
rather than it being wasted. When similar conditions are present, then it is
advised to give that wealth in charity after it is known to be such wealth. And
it is apparent that even up to the time of eating the meat, the husband had
not approved of his wife selling the sheep, hence the author listing this
narration in the chapter related to matters that lead to doubt.

Comments:
Al-Madinah was an agricultural land where people carried out business
operations through dry volume measurements. Hence, their pattern became the
standard unit for measuring the quantities of their goods. Makkah, on the other
hand, was the center of trade for various types of commodities, including valuable
commodities like gold, silver, spices and perfume. These were bought and sold
through measures of weight. Hence the measures in Makkah were accepted as
standard units for gauging or estimating the weight of commodities.

camels at Al-Baqi'; I would price
them in Dinars but accept Dirham,

Comments:
Araya refers to the case when one loans one datepalm tree or two to
someone. It is an act of displaying goodwill towards someone. When
somebody loans one of the trees from his garden to his neighbors or to some
other needy persons, the people getting the tree or trees start frequenting the
garden, which creates an uneasy situation. Exchanging fresh dates of the trees
loaned by the person himself with dried dates was permitted by the
Messenger of Allah , in order to stop the spirit of goodwill from dying
down by the uneasiness caused by the frequent visits of those people into the
garden. It is worth mentioning here that while the exchange of an
undetermined quantity of un-plucked dates with dried dates was declared
Araya refers to a kind of sale in which the owner of dates that are still on the tree can
sell them for dried dates by estimation.

He added: "Ishtimal As-Sammã'
means wrapping oneself in a single
garment, placing the edges of the
garment on the left shoulder and
leaving the right side uncovered.
Munabadhah is when one says: 'If I

Mulamasah means that he touches
it with his hand without unfolding
it or turning it over; if he touches it
the sale becomes binding." 11

It is Sunnah to exchange gifts among friends and relatives. Exchange of gifts
strengthens mutual relations and love. If someone is not in a position to
reciprocate for a gift, he should acknowledge it with praise and thanks saying

1. For someone in the seat of judgment, there is a possibility of making an
unintentional error, and the decision may be inaccurate, therefore, the judge
is not to be blamed for such errors.
2. This statement of the Prophet shows that he was not aware of the future.
3. This narration is a clear proof of the fact that Prophet was also human being.
3584. It was narrated from
'Abdulläh bin Rafi', the freed slave
of Umm Salamah, from Umm
Salamah, who said: "Two men
came to the Messenger of Allah
with a dispute about an inheritance
of theirs, for which they had no
proof except their claims. The
Prophet said..." and he
mentioned a similar report (as no.

and their oaths will precede their witness." (Sahih Al-Bukhari no. 2652) The
witness of such people has been condemned. In this narration, efforts of those

Chapter 19. The Testimony Of
AN Adh-Dhimnuzh And A Will
Made When Traveling
3605. It was narrated from AshSha'bI that death came to a Muslim
man in Daquqa', and he could not
find any Muslim to witness his will,
so he asked two men from AN AlKitãb to witness it. They came to
Al-KUfah and went to AbU MUsa
A1-Ash'ari and told him, and they
brought his estate and his will. AlAsh'arI said: "This is something
that did not happen again after the
incident during the time of the
Messenger of Allah . He asked
them to swear an oath by Allah
after 'Asr (prayer) that they had
not betrayed, lied, changed,
The Book Of Judgments 188
concealed or altered (anything),
and that it was indeed the will and
estate of the man. Then he
accepted their testimony." (Da'iJ)
Comments:
These two narrations show that if a Muslim dies at a place where there is no
Muslim, it is allowed to have a non-Muslim witness, and to confirm the truth
and validity of the testimony, they can be asked to take an oath. The second
narration is also narrated in Sahih AbBukhdri. So it proves that the verdict of
the Prophet was exact according to the revelation.
3606. It was narrated that Ibn
'Abbas said: "A man from BanU
Sahm went out with Tamim AdDan and 'Adiyy bin Badda', and
the Sahmi man died in a land
where there were no Muslims.
When they brought his estate, a
silver cup with lines of gold was
missing. The Messenger of Allah
made them swear an oath, then
the cup was found in Makkah.
They said: "We bought it from
TamIm and 'Adiyy." Two men who
were heirs of the Sahmf man stood
up and swore: "Our testimony is
truer than theirs; the cup belongs
to our companion." Then the
following Verse was revealed
concerning them: "0 you who
believe! When death approaches
any of you, and you make a

paternal uncle, who was one of the
Companions of the Prophet ,
told him that the Prophet
bought a horse from a Bedouin,
and asked him to go with him so
that he could give him the price of
the horse. The Messenger of Allah
walked briskly, but the Bedouin
walked slowly, and people started
intercepting him and making him
offer for the horse, not realizing
that the Prophet had already
bought it. The Bedouin called the
Messenger of Allah , and said:
"If you want to buy this horse then
confirm it, otherwise I shall sell it."
The Prophet stopped when he
heard the call of the Bedouin, and

Comments:
Regarding the principles of witnesses and testimony, Islam provides solutions
to all kind of situations and circumstances. If the claimant has only one
witness, the oath serves the purpose of a second witness. If the claimant has
no witness, and the defendant does not want to swear an oath, the judge can
recommend a compromise. In the case of a compromise, the disputed
property can be divided among the parties.

1. After swearing the oath in the Name of Allah, the defendant is free from the
plaintiffs claim. His character has nothing to do with his oath. He may be a
pious man or a criminal.
2. The claimant can ask the defendant about his true knowledge of the facts
regarding the disputed property. The Prophet did not object when the
Hadrami questioned the man of BanU Kindah if he knew or not.

Knowledge is not merely to know, but it is also to be acted upon, otherwise
having a connection with learned families, and being the progeny of scholars
is of no benefit to a person, and it may likely be a strike against him in the
next life, if he does not act on such knowledge.

It is proven through many authentic narrations that the Companions would
write narrations. Scholars have explained that in the early period of Islam,
they was not allowed to write narrations, so that people may not become
confused about what was the Qur'an, and what was other than that. But when
the Companions learned the Qur'an, and learned the Sunnah, there was no
fear of such confusion with the proliferation of knowledge.

Nabtdh refers to a drink made by soaking fruit of any kind in water, so that
the flavor of the fruit fuses with the water. As long as it does not ferment,
there is no harm in it. When its fermentation begins in starts to bubble and
turn sour, some narrations refer to this later. Once it is realized that it has
fermented, turning into Khamr, it is unlawful.
3685. It was narrated from
'Abdullãh bin 'Amr that the Prophet

[11 AbU Sa'eed Ibn Al-A'rabi is one of those who heard the text from AbU Dawud. In our
edition it is Mudd instead of Mudi but what is correct is Mudi. It is a tank used for water
made of stone, it holds fifteen or more Makuk and one Makuk equals one and a half
Sa'. See Lisan AI-Arab, An-Nihayah and Gharib Al-Hadtth by Al-KhattAbi. And its
meaning is that the Su4ãn had officiated a size for the Mudi and sent it around to be
used for all measurements of that size, and he broke it with a rock. See Walat Misr
(1:23) by Al-Kindi. It appears that some of the copyists made an error in its spelling.

2. Blowing the food or drink for cooling it is not approved. If the food or drink

Chapter 15. Saying Bismillãh
Over Food
3765. It was narrated from Jãbir
bin 'Abdullãh that he heard the
Prophet say: "When a man
enters his house and remembers
Allah upon his entering and when
he eats, the Shailãn says (to himself
or his followers): 'You have no
place to stay and no dinner.' If he
enters and does not remember
Allah when entering, the Shaitãn
says, 'You have found a place to
stay.' If he does not remember
Allah when he eats, (the Sha4an)
says, 'You have found a place to
stay and dinner." (azii)
3766. It was narrated that
Hudhaifah said: "If food was
served when the Messenger of
Allah was with us, none of us
would stretch forth our hands until
the Messenger of Allah
stretched forth his hand first. We
were going to eat with him one
time, when a Bedouin came
rushing, as if he were being
pursued. He went to stretch forth
his hand to the food, but the
Messenger of Allah took hold
of his hand. Then a young girl
came rushing, as if she were being
pursued. She went to stretch forth
her hand to the food, but the

Messenger of Allah took hold

of Allah said: 'The Shaitãn
regards food as permissible (for
himself) if the Name of Allah is
not mentioned over it. He brought
this Bedouin so that the food might
become permissible for him
through him, but I took hold of his
hand. Then he brought this young
girl so that the food might become

It is said that the statement "by my life" which appears to be a statement of
swearing, means, "by my Lord who controls my life," or meanings similar to
that, and other explanations are also offered. A number of the Companions
and their followers also used such a statement on occasion, according to what
is authentically narrated from them. However, it is advisable for us to avoid it,
because of the possible bad connotation of it, and Allah knows best.
3897. It was narrated from Ibn
Ja'far, from Shu'bah, from
'Abdullãh bin AN As-Safar, from
Ash-Sha'bi, from Khãrijah bin ASalt, from his paternal uncle, that
he said that he passed by... (and in
it): "I did Ruqyah for him, reciting
the Opening of the Book for three
days, morning and evening, and
every time he completed it," he
collected his saliva and spat. It was
as if he had been released from
bonds. They gave him something,
and he came to the Prophet ...

The Book Of Medicine 326
Companions of the Prophet
went out on a journey, and they
traveled, then they halted near one
of the Arab tribes. Some of them
said: "Our chief has been stung; do
any of you have anything that may
be of benefit to our companion?"
One man said: "Yes, by Allah, I
can do Ruqyah, but we asked you
for hospitality and you refused to
welcome us. I will not do Ruqyah
until you agree to give me some
payment." They agreed to give him
a flock of sheep. So he went to
him, and recited the Essence of the
Book (Al-Fãtihah) over him, and
blew on him until he was healed as
if released from bonds. Then they
gave them the payment that had
been agreed upon. They said:
"Divide it." The one who had done
the Ruqyah said: "Do not do
anything until we come to the
Messenger of Allah and consult
him" The next day they came to
the Messenger of Allah Jç and told
him about that, and the Messenger
of Allah said: "How did you
know that it is a Ruqyah? Well
done! Distribute them, and give me
a share with you." (az1h)
[ ] : Comments: -
It is an obligation on the residents of a place to be hospitable, providing food
and drink to a guest or traveler. If someone does not fulfill the rights of a
guest, the guest has the right to take what he needs. Some scholars use this
incident as proof that it is lawful to accept a fee for Ruqyah, provided relief
from the ailment results.

Abü Nadrah, from Abü Sa'eed AlKhudri who said: "When the
Messenger of Allah put on a

it. I ask You for its good and the
good of that for which it was made,

evil and the evil of that for which it
was made.)" (Hasan)

women and prohibited for men.

Comments:
In this narration, pride has been likened to Kufr, the opposite of Faith, and
the reason for that becomes clear from the next narration. The statement 'will

Ahadith mentioning the gravity of Isbdl are of two categories; that mentioning
the Fire for whatever is below the ankles, indicating its prohibition in general,
and that mentioning that Allah does not look at whoever does it out of pride
and conceit. Therefore, whoever knowingly does so, after the text have been
made clear, he falls into the category of those who reject the truth, and
belittle the people, or those who do so out of pride. Hence the wisdom in the
author's organization of these narrations is clear.

Chapter 1. What Was
Mentioned About Every
Century
4291. It was narrated from Ayyub,
from Sharãhil bin Yazid AlMa'ãfirI, from AbU 'Alqamah, from
AbU Hurairah - as far as I known -
from the Messenger of Allah bz,
who said: "At the beginning of
every century Allah will send to
this Ummah someone who will
renew its religion." (Ijasan)
AbU Dãwud said: It was narrated
by 'Abdur-RahmAn bin Shuraib AlIskandrãni and he did not go
beyond Sharabi01'
Comments:
Malãhim is plural of Malhamah, which is derived from the word Lahm, used
for flesh in relation to people, and meat in relation to animals. So the
meaning is violent fighting and shedding of blood. And the meaning of
"someone who will renew its religion" is that there will be those who remain
upon the truth - as stated in other narrations - even when innovation and sin
are rampant. So at such times there will remain people who will call to the
Sunnah and fight against innovations that distort the religion, whether the one
reviving the religion be only one person, or more than one.
Ill Implying that he narrated it up to Sharahil as his own saying.

Jubair said: "Let us go to Dhu
Mikhbar, one of the Companions
of the Prophet ." So we went to
him, and Jubair asked him about
the Truce. He said: 'I heard the
Messenger of Allah iii say: "You
will make peace with the Romans
in a secure truce, and you and they
will fight an enemy who is behind
you, and you will be victorious,
seize spoils of war, and be safe.
Then you will return, and camp in
a meadow where there are mounds.
A Christian man will raise the cross
and will say: "The cross has
prevailed." A Muslim man will get
angry and break it, at which point
the Romans will betray (the truce)
and prepare for battle." (Sahi?z)

Comments:
Only Allah makes the disbelievers fear the believers, and only when they are
worthy of the name "believers." And this remains true only as long as they
abide by the true teachings of the religion. It is only through that prescription
that they were blessed with success in this life and the Hereafter from their
Lord. The more the Muslims go away from their religion, from the teachings
in the Sunnah, the more their enemies become fearless of them, and no
matter what they do beyond following the Sunnah, they will never have the
ability to bring about other than humiliation.

the Messenger of Allah had
finished the prayer, he sat on the

he said: "Do you know why I called
you together?" They said: "Allah

Comments:
"Change it" meaning, from Munkar or evil, to Ma 'ruf or goodness. And this
narration mentions three levels, covering faith; in the heart, with the tongue
and with the limbs, and the least of it, "with his heart," is faith.
4341. AbU Umayyah Ash-Sha'bãni
said: "I asked AbU Tha'labah AlKhushani: '0 AbU Tha'labah, what
do you say about this Verse: "Take
care of your ownselves."?'11' He
said: 'By Allah, you have asked one
who has knowledge about it. I asked
the Messenger of Allah about it
and he said: "Rather you should
enjoin one another to do that which
is good and forbid one another from
that which is evil, until when you see
avarice being obeyed and whims
being followed, this world being
preferred and everyone admiring his
own opinion, then you should take
care of your own self and ignore the
common folk. Ahead of you there
are days of patience, when patience
will be like grasping live coals, and
the one who does good deeds will
have the reward of fifty men who do
deeds like his." Someone else
added: "He said: '0 Messenger of
Allah, the reward of fifty of them?'
He said: 'The reward of fifty of
you." (Ijasan)

to Yemen, then he sent Mu'ãdh

Then they spoke about Qiyam AlLail (voluntary night prayer), and - -
one of them - Mu'ãdh bin Jabal -

'Abdullãh bin AN Burdah, from
The Book Of Legal Punishments 18
Abü Burdah, from Abü Musa, who
said: "Mu'ãdh came to 'All while I
was in Yemen, and there was a
man who had been Jewish, then he
accepted Islam, then he apostatized

Comments:
The apostate should be given a chance to review his decision and accept Islam
again, before a legal judgment is passed in his case.
4356. This story was narrated by
Ash-Shaibãni, from AbU Burdah.
He said: "A man who had
apostatized from Islam was brought
to AbU MUsA, and he called him
(to Islam) for twenty days or so.
Then Mu'ãdh came and called him,
but he refused, so his head was
chopped off." (Sahih)
AbU Dãwud said: It was narrated
by 'Abdul-Malik bin 'Umair from
AbU Burdah, but he did not
mention his being asked to repent.
It was narrated by Ibn Fulail from
Ash-Shaibani, from Sa'eed bin AN
Burdah, from his father, from AbU

being asked to repent.

'Abbãs said: "Abdullãh bin Sa'd
bin AN As-Sarh was a scribe for
the Messenger of Allah jç. Then
the Shaitãn caused him to go
astray, and he joined the
disbelievers. The Messenger of

protection." (Hasan)

Comments:
The protection granted by one Muslim is applicable to all Muslims, meaning
they must all abide by it, see nos. 2763-2764.

said: "On the Day of the Conquest
of Makkah, 'Abdullãh bin Sa'd bin

Prophet and said: '0 Messenger

some people from 'Ukl - or he
said: from 'Urainah - came to the
Messenger of Allah but they
found that the climate of AlMadinah made them unwell, so the
Messenger of Allah told them
to go to the much-camels and drink
their urine and milk. So they went
there, then when they became well
again, they killed the herdsman of
the Messenger of Allah and
drove off the camels. News of that
reached the Prophet at the
beginning of the day, and he sent
people after them. The day had not
advanced very far before they were
brought. He ordered that their
hands and feet be cut off and their
eyes be branded, then they were
thrown in the Ijarrah' 1 where they
asked for water but were not given
any. (Sahih)
Abu Qilabah said: "They were
people who stole and killed, and
they disbelieved after having

Al-Uajjaj bin YUsuf asked Anas about the severest punishment the Messenger
of AllahilJ applied, and Anas narrated this story. When this reached AlHasan Al-Basri he commented that he wished Anas would not have told him
about that. This is because, according to some narrations, A1-Hajjaj stated on
the Minbar: "Anas narrated to me..." and he decided that it would be good to
do the same with whoever opposed him. See Al-Bukhãt no. 5685 (The part of
the narration in question is not translated in the published edition of the
English translation of SahTh Al-Bukhãri)

it during the Battle of the Trench, when they aided the disbelievers among
the Quraish, and fought along with them against the Muslims. After the battle
was over, the Muslims besieged the tribe, and later, the Jews showed their
consent to accept the decision of Sa'd bin Mu'ãdh. He gave his verdict that

that Khãlid bin Al-Lajlaj narrated
to him, that his father, Al-Lajlaj
informed him, that he was sitting
working in the marketplace, when a
woman passed by carrying a child.
The people rushed towards her and
I rushed with them. I came to the
Prophet and he was saying:
"Who is the father of this (child)
who is with you?" She remained
silent, but a young man who was by
her side said: "I am his father, 0
Messenger of Allah." The
Messenger of Allah looked at
some of those who were around
him, and asked them about him,
and they said: "We know nothing
but good (about this man)." The
Prophet said to him: "Have you
been married?" he said: "Yes." So
he ordered that he be stoned. He
said: "We took him out. We dug a
pit for him, and put him there,
then we stoned him until he died.
Then a man came asking about the
one who had been stoned, and we
took him to the Prophet and
said: 'This man has come asking
about the evildoer.' He said:
'He is better before Allah than the
fragrance of musk.' That man was
his father, so we helped him to
wash him, and shroud him, and
bury him." I do not know whether
he mentioned offering the funeral
prayer for him or not. This is the

him, that a man among them fell
sick, and wasted away, until he was
little more than skin and bones.
The slave woman of one of them
entered upon him, and he was
cheered by the sight of her, and
had intercourse with her. When
some men of his people entered
upon him to visit him, he told them
about that, and said: "Consult the
Messenger of Allah for me, for
I had intercourse with a slave
woman who entered upon me."
They mentioned that to the
Messenger of Allah and said:
"We do not think that any of the
people is as weak as he is. If we
bring him to you his bones will
disintegrate. He is no more than
skin and bones." So the Messenger
of Allah ordered them to take
one hundred branches and strike
him with them once. (Sahih)

If there is fear of the offender running away, then it is allowed to detain him.
If the murderer is killed due to legal retaliation, it is hoped that him
submitting to the penalty will also count as his atonement. In the case of
blood money or pardon, Allah will judge him as He wills.

Comments:
Al-Qasamah is derived from Qasam (oath) and it means taking oaths in
repetition. Here, it refers to the cases wherein a person is killed, and there
are no witnesses. Then fifty persons from the claimant tribe will swear about
the suspect or suspects that they are the murderers. If the claimants take an
oath, the respondent will pay the blood money. If the claimant tribe does not
take an oath, the defendant will swear that they are not the killers and they
are not aware of the killer, so they will be free of blame, and they will not
have to pay the blood money. It will be paid from the public treasury. If the
defendant tribe does not swear, they will have to present the murderer or pay
the blood money.

said: "By Allah, you killed him."
They said: "By Allah, we did not
kill him." He went to his people,
and told them about that, then he
and his brother Huwayyisah - who
was older than him - and his cousin
'Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl, came (to
the Prophet ). Muliayyiah
started to speak, as he was the one
who had been in Khaibar, but the
Messenger of Allah said: "Let
the eldest speak, let the eldest
speak." So Huwayyisah spoke, then
Muhayyiah spoke. The Messenger
of Allah said: "Let them pay the
Diyah for your companion, or else
prepare for war." The Messenger of
Allah Q5, wrote to them saying that,
and they wrote back saying: "By
Allah, we did not kill him." The
Messenger of Allah said to
Ijuwayyiah, Muhayyiah and
'Abdur-Rahmãn: "Will you swear,
so that you may be entitled to
(blood money) for your
companion?" They said: "No." He
said: "Then should the Jews swear
an oath for you?" They said: "They
are not Muslims." So the
Messenger of Allah paid the
Diyah himself, and the Messenger
of Allah sent them one hundred
camels. Sahl said: "A red she-camel

Comments:
For making judgments in crimes, non-Muslims may be asked to swear in the
Name of Allah provided the Muslim defendant or accused agrees to that.
There are penalties in Islam for such cases, whether the case involves
Muslims or non-Muslims. If it is not known who the murderer is, then the
blood money is paid from the public treasury.

the teeth that come between the
front teeth and the eyeteeth, then
it is a Sadis or Sadas. When it

This book is named the Book of the Sunnah, to indicate the creed of the
people of the Sunnah, or AN As-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. This creed is called
"Sunnah" because Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama 'ah are unique among the groups,
in that they take their beliefs from the Sunnah, and this is what differentiates
them from all of the groups of innovation.

Comments:
The Mutashãbihãt (not entirely clear) could have various meanings. Those
who have a perversion in their hearts, the people of desires and innovation,
attempt to interpret the Mutashabihat in a way that opposes the Mu/ikamat or
"entirely clear" Verses, or contrary to the Sunnah, intending to cause Fitnah
and lead others astray.

Comments:
See number 4681, which is similar, but instead of "the most virtuous of
deeds" it is "whoever does..." "he will have perfected his faith." And this
narration is in this chapter because it indicates that one should hate
innovation and those who call to it, for the sake of Allah, as they should love
the truth and its people for the sake of Allah.
4600. It was narrated that
'Abdullãh bin Ka'b bin Malik -
who was the one among his sons
who served as Ka'b's guide when
he became blind - said: "I heard
Ka'b bin Malik - and Ibn As-Sarh

bin 'Amirah - who was one of the
companions of Mu'adh bin Jabal -
informed him, that he never sat in a
gathering of remembrance without
saying: "Allah is a just Judge, may
those who doubt perish." Mu'ãdh
bin Jabal said one day: "Ahead of
you there are trials in which there
will be a great deal of wealth, and
the Qur'an will be so easy that
believers and hypocrites, men and
women, young and old, slave and
free will all learn it. Then soon a
man will say: 'Why don't the people
follow me when I have read the
Qur'an. They will not follow me
until I innovate something else for
them.' So beware of that which is
innovated, for that which is
innovated is misguidance. And
beware of the deviation of a man of
wisdom, for the Shaitãn may utter
words of misguidance on the lips of a
man of wisdom, and a hypocrite may
speak a word of truth." He said: "I
said to Mu'ãdh: 'How could I tell,
may Allah have mercy on you, when
the man of wisdom speaks a word of
misguidance, and the hypocrite
speaks a word of truth?' He said:
'Rather, avoid the wise man's words
that become well known and it is
said about them: "What is this?" and
that should not avert you from him,
because he may retract it. And you
should accept the truth when you
hear it, for the truth has light."

Sunnah was only instituted by the
one who knows what opposing,
would lead to, of error, slipping,
foolishness and extremism. So
accept for yourself that which the
people accepted for themselves, for
their actions were based on
knowledge, and due to their virtue,
they are more worthy. If right
guidance is what you are following,
then you are saying that you
reached it before them, and we
could say that whatever is
innovated after them was never
innovated except by those who
followed a way other than their
way, and who wanted to be
different than them, because they
are the vanguard (of Islam) and
they spoke about it (matters of the
religion) in a sufficient and
comprehensive manner. Nobody
refrained from discussing matters
of religion that there was no need
to discuss like they did. And
nobody explained issues of religion
that need to be explained like they
did. But nowadays you find some
people who refrain from discussing
issues of religion that need to be
discussed, and thus they go to one
extreme; and you find others who
discuss issues of religion that there
is no need to discuss, and thus they
go to the other extreme. Verily
they (the Salaf) were in-between
both, following the right guidance.
You wrote, asking about
affirmation of Al-Qadar (the Divine
Decree). Well, you have come to
one who is well informed, by Allah's
permission. I do not know of any

innovation that the people have
introduced that is clearer and more
obvious than (rejecting) affirmation
of Al-Qadar (the divine decree).
The ignorant people mentioned it
during Jãhili)yah and spoke of it in
their words and their poetry,
consoling themselves for what they
had lost, then Islam only reinforced
it (the belief in Al-Qadar) after that.
The Messenger of Allah
mentioned it in more than one or
two Hadith, and the Muslims heard
it from him, and spoke of it during
his lifetime and after his death, out
of certain belief and in submission
to their Lord, and they believed that
it is impossible that there is
anything that is not encompassed by
His knowledge and recorded in His
Book or comes to pass by His
decree. Moreover, it is mentioned
in His Book; from it they have
derived it and from it they have
learned it. If you say: Why did Allah
reveal such and such a Verse and
why did He say such and such, they
have read what you have read, and
they know its interpretation of
which you are ignorant, and yet they
said: All of this is recorded and
decreed. Doom is by decree and
what has been decreed will come to
pass. What Allah wills happens, and
what He does not will, does not
happen. We possess no power to
benefit or harm ourselves. But
nevertheless they were still keen (to
do good deeds) and they were
afraid (of doing evil deeds)." (Pali)

He said: As for the cloud, it is the
cloud of Islam, and as for the ghee
and honey that were dripping from
it, that is the Qur'an with its
softness and sweetness. As for
those who take a lot and a little,
they are the ones who learn a lot

rope that stretches between heaven

disbelieve you.' Uudhaifah came to
Salman when he was in a vegetable
patch and said: '0 Salman, what
kept you from confirming what I
heard from the Messenger of Allah
?' Salman said: 'The Messenger
of Allah would (sometimes) get
angry, and he would say things to
some of his Companions in anger,
and he would (sometimes) be
pleased, and say things to some of
his Companions when he was
pleased. You should stop
(narrating these sayings) lest you
instil love of some people in
people's hearts and hatred for
some people in people's hearts,
and generate disagreement and
division. You know that the
Messenger of Allah delivered a
speech and said: "If I reviled or
cursed any man among my Ummah
in anger, I am just one of the sons
of Adam, I get angry as they get
angry. But I have been sent as a
mercy to the worlds. [0 Allah],
make it a blessing for them on the
Day of Resurrection." By Allah,
you should stop or I shall certainly
write to 'Umar,' [but he sent some
men to intercede for him. So
Salman offered expiation for his
oath, and did not write to 'Umar,
and he offered the expiation before
breaking his oath."] (Hasan)
Comments:
"If I reviled or cursed any man among my Ummah in anger, I am just one of
the sons of Adam, I get angry as they get angry." Meaning, he may have
gotten angry, but his supplications are accepted, etc., so this point is specific
to those who angered him.

Al-Ida' means: "defer" or "hope." Al-Murji'ah is the name of the people who
believe that the commission of a sin will not cause any harm to one's faith,
just like the commission of an act of faith is of no benefit to a disbeliever. So
they are described as such due to their belief that Allah will defer punishment
from the disobedient person. It was also used earlier, to refer to those who
deferred judgment between the two sides of dispute after 'Uthman, may Allah

be pleased with him. (See Hadi As-Sari the introduction to Fath Al-Ban, near
the end of the ninth section.) According to the majority of the early and later
scholars, Iman includes actions, while it became a popular Murji'ah belief that
actions were not included in Faith. So these narrations prove that actions are
included in Faith.

Al-Khattabi said: "At-Taruk (leaving the prayer) has three categories. Among
them is leaving (the prayer) while (fundamentally) denying it (that it should
be performed). And this is Kufr according to the consensus of the Ummah.
Among them is leaving it because of forgetfulness; in this case there is a
consensus of the Ummah that one has not committed Kufr. (Meaning, he is
The Book Of The Sunnah 199
required to pray when he remembers it). Among them is purposefully leaving
it (the prayer) without (fundamentally) denying it (that it should be
performed). It is this that the people have differed over. Ibrahim An-Nakha'i,
Ibn Al-Mubärak, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ishaq bin RahUyah held the view
that whoever left the prayer on purpose, without an excuse, until its time has
expired, then he is a disbeliever. And Al:imad said: 'We do not declare anyone
among the Muslims, a disbeliever, for any sin, except for leaving the prayer.'
MakhUl and Ash-Shãfi'i said that he who leaves the prayer should be killed
like a disbeliever, but that does not take him out of the religion, and he
should be buried in the graveyard of Muslims, and his family inherits from
him. But some of the followers of Ash-Shafi'i said that he should not be
prayed for when he dies. And the followers of Ash-Shafi'I differed over how
he should be killed. Most of them held the view that he should be killed in
captivity with the sword. Ibn Shuraili said that he should not be killed in
captivity with the sword, but he should be beaten until he prays, or beating
him results in his death. And they said that he should be killed when he
leaves one prayer until its time has expired. Except that AbU Sa'eed AlAtai said that he should not be killed until he left three prayers. And I
think that he held this view because it is possible that he had an excuse to
delay the prayer until the next prayer's time, in order to combine the two of
them. AbU Hanifah and his followers said that the one who leaves the prayer
is not considered a disbeliever, nor killed, but he should be imprisoned and
beaten until he prays. They interpreted the narration to have an implication
of severe warning and threat." (Ma 'alam As-Sunan no. 1658)

It this narration, not praying has been explained to be a cause of defect in
religion. Even though a woman during her menses is not allowed to pray, so
she is exempted from the duty, the argument here is that the prayer itself is
part of the religion, and when it is not performed, the religion of the person is
deficient. If this is the case for those who have a legal reason, then what of
those who do not.

This narration following the previous, stresses that calling a Muslim a

Zoroastrians believe in a god of light, or good, and a god of darkness or evil.
Similarly, the Qadariyah held the view that Allah did not know what
creatures would do before they do it, so if the creatures do evil, it is by their
own initiation. While believing in Al-Qadar means that we believe that Allah
has pre-ordained all matters in every detail, with complete knowledge of it all
before its existence, the good and the bad.

In this narration, as well as the following, the issue of compulsion and choice
is explained. Creatures have no choice in their complexion and their
temperament, this is decided by Allah, but they have the choice to strive for
betterment, and are provided the guidance by their Lord for that endeavor.
4694. It was narrated that 'All
said: "We were at a funeral with
the Messenger of Allah in Baqi'
Al-Gharqad. The Messenger of
Allah came and sat down, and
he had a stick with him, and he
started to scratch the ground with
his stick. Then he raised his head
and said: 'There is no one among
you, no soul that is born, but Allah
has written his place in the Fire or
in Paradise, whether he is in misery
or happiness.' A man among the
people said: '0 Prophet of Allah,
should we not then rely upon what
is written and leave works? For the
one who is decreed to be among
the happy will be happy and the
one who is decreed to be among
the miserable will be miserable.'
He said: 'Do works, for each
person will be facilitated. Those
who are decreed to be among the
happy will be facilitated to do
actions that lead to happiness, and
those who are decreed to be among
the miserable will be facilitated to
do deeds that will lead to misery."
Then the Prophet of Allah said:
As for him who gives (in charity)
The Book Of The Sunnah 207
and keeps his duty to Allah and
fears Him. And believes in AlHusnã. We will make smooth for
him the path of ease (goodness).
But he who is a miser and thinks
himself self-sufficient. And belies
A1-Husnã We will make smooth for
him the path for evil."['] (Sahih)

4695. It was narrated from
Kahmas, from Ibn Buraidah, from
Yahya bin Ya'mar, who said: "The
first one to speak about Al-Qadar
in Al-Basrah was Ma'bad AlJuhanI. Humaid bin 'AbdurRabman Al-imyarI and I went for
Ijajj or 'Umrah, and we said: 'If we
meet any of the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah , we will ask
him about what these people are
saying about Al-Qadar.' Allah
caused us to meet 'Abdullãh bin
'Umar entering the Masjid, so my
companion and I surrounded him. I
thought that my companion would
leave the talking to me, so I said:
'0 Abu 'Abdur-Rahman. Some
people have appeared among us
who recite the Qur'an, and they
strive hard in seeking knowledge,
and they claim that there is no
Qadar (Divine Decree), and that
matters just happen (without
predestination).' He said: 'If you

have nothing to do with them and
they have nothing to do with me.
By the One by Whom 'Abdullãh
bin 'Umar swears, if one of them
had the equivalent of Ubud in
gold, and spent it, Allah would not
accept it from him unless he
believed in Al-Qadar (the divine
decree).'
Then he said: "Umar bin AlKhattab narrated to me: "While we
were with the Messenger of Allah
, there came to us a man whose
clothes were exceedingly white, and
whose hair was exceedingly black;
no signs of travel could be seen on
him, and we did not recognize him.
He came and sat before the
Messenger of Allah , resting his
knees against his knees, and he
placed his hands on his thighs, and
said: '0 Muhammad, tell me about
Islam.' The Messenger of Allah
said: 'Islam is to bear witness to La
ilãha illallãh, and that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah, to
establish the Salãt, to pay the
Zakãh, to fast Ramadan, and to
perform kIajj to the House if you
are able to bear the journey.' He
said: 'You have spoken the truth."
He ('Umar) said: "We were
amazed at his asking him, and
confirming what he said. He said:
'Tell me about faith.' He said: '(It
is) to believe in Allah, His Angels,
His Books, His Messengers and the
Last Day, and believing in AlQadar (the Divine Decree), both
good and bad.' He said: 'You have
spoken the truth.' He said: 'Tell me
about Al-Ihsãn.' He said: '(It is) to

worship Allah as if you can see
Him, and although you cannot see
Him, He can see you.' He said:
'Tell me about the Hour.' He said:
'The one who is asked about it,
does not know any more than the
one who is asking.' He said: 'Tell
me of its signs.' He said: 'When the
slave woman gives birth to her
mistress, and when you see the
barefoot, naked destitute shepherds
competing in the construction of
lofty buildings.' Then he went
away. I waited for three (days),
then he said: '0 'Umar, do you
know who the questioner was?' I
said: 'Allah and His Messenger
know best.' He said: 'It was Jibril
who came to you to teach you your
religion." (.ahii)

Comments
The last phrase of the narration explains the objective of it, and its
importance. The Prophet explained faith through different examples, and
this is one of the most important and most popularly quoted Hadiths
regarding it. In it, he defined faith with matters of creed, although he
explained it in other narrations by mentioning actions, even listing the pillars
of Islam as a definition of faith. I,zsãn means to do well, or be generous, and
sometimes it means beneficence. Here the definition is clearly given regarding
its application to the religion, that it is to worship Allah with an attentive
heart, concentration, humility, just as the worshipper will behave on the Day
of Judgement standing before his Lord. This is the fruit of Islam and faith, it
produces a result just like a tree; when its trunk and roots are healthy, it
grows branches, and when its branches are also healthy, it produces fruit. The
knowledge of the exact time of the Hour is known only to Allah, but the
Messenger was given indication of some of its signs. The scholars
elaborated on various possible interpretations of his saying: "The slave
woman gives birth to her mistress" that is, her daughter will be in some form
of authority over her. Many groups have tried to give esoteric meanings to
these signs, restricting them to this or that people in particular. However, the
descriptions are general, and they are obvious. The second sign describes
The Book Of The Sunnah 210
nomadic herdsmen who vie with each other in constructing lofty structures.
Neither of these two signs are indications of something that is unlawful:
Captive women throughout Islamic history gave birth to important figures,
after the death of the Prophet , such events were widespread; and nomadic
shepherds have dominated in many Islamic societies, from areas in northern
Africa, to Asia and the Balkans, as well as Arabia. What we see in common
throughout our history that fulfills these signs, is an indication of the Hour
being near, and, a testimony to the truth of the Message of the Messenger ,
it is not an indication of other than that, contrary to the interpretation of
some extreme groups.
4696. It was narrated from
'Uthmãn bin Ghiyath: "Abdullãh
bin Buraidah narrated to me, from
Yaya bin Ya'mar and Uumaid bin
'Abdur-Rahman, who said: "We
met 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and we
mentioned Al-Qadar to him and
what they were saying about it..."
He mentioned a similar report- and
added: "A man from Muzainah or
Juhainah questioned him. So he
said: '0 Messenger of Allah, for
what do we do works? Is it for
something that has passed and
been decided, or is it for something
that happens now (without
predestination)?' He said: 'For
something that has passed and
been decided.' The man, or one of
the people, said: 'So why should we
do works?' He said: 'The
inhabitants of Paradise will be
facilitated to do the deeds of the
inhabitants of Paradise, and the
inhabitants of the Fire will be
facilitated to do the deeds of the
inhabitants of Hell." (Sahih)

"0 people, I heard the Messenger

theirs, and your prayer will not
compare to theirs, and your fasting

think that it is to their credit, but in
fact it will count against them.
Their prayer will not go beyond
their collarbones, and they will pass
out of Islam as an arrow passes out
of its target. If the army that
attacks them knew what has been
decreed for them upon the tongue
of their Prophet , they would
have relied on their deeds. The
sign of that is that among them
there is a man who has an upper
arm but no forearm, and on his
upper arm there is something like a

nipple, with white hairs on it.
Would you go to Mu'ãwiyah and
the people of Ash-Sham, and leave
these people in charge of your
families and wealth in your
absence? By Allah, I hope that
they are the same people, for they
have shed blood unlawfully and
attacked the people's cattle. March
in the Name of Allah." Zaid bin
Wahb described to me the stops
(made by the army), until he said:
"Then we crossed a bridge, and
when we met (the Khawarij), who
were being led that day by
'Abdullãh bin Wahb Ar-Rasibi, he
('Abdullãh) said to (his men):
'Throw your spears and draw your
swords from their sheaths, for I am
afraid that they may urge you to
negotiate, as they did on the Day
of Uarura'.' So they threw their
spears and unsheathed their
swords, and (the companions of
'All) fought back with their spears,
and they (the Khawãrij) were killed,
and piled up one atop another, but
only two of the people (meaning
companions of 'All) were killed
that day. 'All said: 'Search among
them for the one with the
deformed hand.' But they did not
find him. Then 'All himself went to
some people who had been killed,
and were lying on top of one
another. They took them out, and
found him among those who were
closest to the ground (at the
bottom of the pile). He said the
Takbir, and said: 'Allah spoke the
truth, and His Messenger conveyed
it.' 'Ubaidah Al-Salmãnl stood up

there is none worthy of worship' -

times and he did so." (Sahih)

the amount of what he heard
versus what he did not hear is
Shu'bah, and the one who reported
most among them is Hisham, and
the one who memorized the most
is Sa'eed bin Abi 'ArUbah."
AbU Dãwud said: So I mentioned
that to Ahmad, and he said:
"Sa'eed bin AN 'ArUbah - in the
story about Hisham - they
mentioned all of this about Mu'ädh
bin Hishãm; what would be the
case if Hisham was compared to
Sa'eed were he to have appeared
before him." [21
This is about the companions of Qatadah, and 'All bin 'Abdullah is 'Ali bin Al-Madini.

been in the presence of Sa'eed with all of his knowledge. This section was explained by

Comments:
There are no authentic narrations mentioning the name of this person, some
of the scholars, like Ibn Battal, Al-Qadi 'Iyad, Al-Qurtubi, and An-Nawawi
say it is, 'Uyainah bin Uin bin Uudhaifah bin Badr Al-Fazãri. (See Fati AlBdif no. 6032). All of this is based upon narrations that do not have
connected or authentic chains, similarly, it is said that his name was
Makhramah bin Nawfal. In any case, Allah's Messenger knew something
about this person that was not apparent, and his speaking of him in that
manner was of benefit, and was not a form of backbiting.

Modesty: Modesty is a particular natural disposition which appears in the
mind on doing well known deeds and sometimes during performing improper
deeds. This state of mind is a sort of blessing and result of a special kind of
conflict between two opposite sentiments. Sometimes people link it with
inability of doing something good, but it is more cowardness than modesty.
Chapter 6. Modesty (Al-Hayã)
4795. It was narrated from Ibn
'Umar that the Prophet passed
by an Ancari man who was

modesty. The Messenger of Allah

Comments:
He was either exhorting him to be modest, or censuring him for being too modest,
and perhaps the second is more obvious. And they say that all of modesty is good,
because it makes one hesitate from doing evil, so even if one is not modest for
religious reasons, their natural modesty still helps prevent them from evil.

prayer is an obligatory prayer or a

obligatory prayer, and it is the
prayer of the Messenger of Allah

except something that I forgot.' He
said: 'The Messenger of Allah
used to say: "Do not be harsh with
yourselves lest you be dealt with
harshly, for some people were
harsh with themselves, and Allah
dealt with them harshly, and their
remnants are to be found in the
monasteries and hermitages. But

their town had fallen down on its

The scholars of Hadith have inferred the following points, as well as others,
from this narration: Rhythmical speech is legal and permitted; within moral
limits, fun and amusement is allowed. Treating children with love and
amusing statements is a sign of good manners. At a young age, a Kunyah can
be adopted. Lawful pets are allowed. See Ma 'alam As-Sunan.

Abü Dãwud said: This is how it was

Amongst the Arabs it was customary to spend lavishly after drinking wine,
and they considered that a sign of generosity and were proud of that. The
grapes from which the wine was extracted were given the name of "Karam"
(generosity). When Allah prohibited drinking wine, the use of the word
"Karam" for grapes was also prohibited.

of you were to be filled with pus, it
would be better for him than being
filled with poetry." (ahih)
AbU 'All said: 11 "I heard that Abü
'Ubaid said: 'What it means is
when his heart is filled to such an
extent that it distracts him from the
Qur'an and remembrance of Allah.
But if the Qur'an and knowledge
are dominant, then in our view his
heart will not be filled with poetry.
"Some eloquence is magic" - it
seems that what is meant is when
he is so eloquent that he praises a
man, and says what is true about
him, so he makes people believe
what he says, then he criticizes him
and says what is true about him, so
he makes people believe what he
says, and it is as if he is bewitching
his audience."

good dreams that come true are a form of good news for the righteous.
5019. It was narrated from AbU
Hurairah that the Prophet said:
"When the time draws near, a
Muslim's dream will hardly be
false, and the truest of them in
dreams will be the truest of them
in speech. Dreams are of three
types: Righteous dreams, which are
glad tidings from Allah; bad
dreams, which come from the
Shaitãn; and dreams that come
from what a man is thinking of to
himself. If one of you sees
something that he dislikes, let him
arise and pray, and not tell the
people about it." He (Abü
Hurairah) said: "I like fetters and I
dislike yokes. Fetters mean
steadfastness in religion." (ahih)
AbU Dawud said: "When the time

occasions: before Fajr (morning)
alãh (prayer), and while you put
off your clothes for the noonday

alãh (prayer). (These) three times
are of privacy for you; other than
these times there is no sin on you
or on them to move about - AlQa'nabi (one of the narrators)
recited up to: And AllAh is AllKnowing, All-Wise."[']Ibn 'Abbas
said: "Allah is Forbearing,
Compassionate towards the
believers, and He loves
concealment. The people did not
have curtains or screens in their
houses, and a servant, or child, or
orphan girl under a man's care
might enter when the man was
having intercourse with his wife, so
Allah commanded them to seek
permission to enter at those times
of undress, so Allah enjoined
concealment and goodness for
them, but I did not see anyone
doing that afterwards." (Ijasan)

the matter to himself, then when its
owner came to the Messenger of
Allah 40, and greeted him with
Salam, he turned away from him.
He did that several times, until the
man realized that he was angry,
because he was turning away from
him. He complained about that to

misfortune for its owner except
what cannot, what cannot,"

done without. (Hasan)

Muslim male names in conjunction with a Divine Attribute of Allah, meaning
servant or slave. Examples include Abdullah ('Abd-Allah—servant of Allah),
Abdur-Rahman ('Abd Ar-Rahman—servant of the Most Merciful), and Abdul-Khaliq ('Abd Al-Khaliq—servant of the Creator).
'Abid: (i) One who preoccupies himself with 'Ibadah (worship) and
shows relatively less interest towards knowledge.
'AbIr: (.i ) A mixture of saffron with other perfumes.
Abtah or Bathã: ( L.J ) (See Muhassab) Literally means earth of
small pebbles. These are found usually on the course where water flows at
times. Usually this word is used for the former valley between Safa and Marwah, and an open land between Makkah and Mina called Muhassab.
Abyãr 'All: () i) The name of a place where Shajarah Mosque is
situated, 7 km outside of Al-Madinah.
'Ad: () An ancient tribe or nation that lived after the Prophet Noah . It

Ad-Dabür: )Westerly wind.
AdahI: (Lfl) Sacrifices.
Adam: () The first human being created by Allah and the first Prophet
sent on earth to establish monotheism as the original religion for mankind.
Adhan: (3 )The call for the daily five obligatory prayers is called Adhan.
The person who calls the Adhan is called a Mu'adhdhin. The 'Adhan consists
of specific phrases, recited aloud in Arabic prior to each of the five daily
worship times. These phrases are as follows: Allãhu Akbar, Allãhu Akbar; Allãhu Akbar, Allahu Akbar; Ash-hadu an la ilãha illallãh, Ash-hadu an la ilaha

'Alid Alastu: (...Ji ..) (Covenant of Alast) Before creating human
beings, Allah asked their souls: "Am I not (Alastu) your Lord?" And
they all answered: "Yes! We testify!" At the Resurrection it will be determined whether each individual remained faithful to his original testimony. In other words, did his actions reflect his pre-creation acceptance
of servanthood and Allah's Lordship? Or did his actions demonstrate that
he lived the life of a denier—one whose life was a denial of the Covenant of Alast? This Covenant is mentioned in SUrat Ar-Ra'd (13:20) and
SUrat Yd-Sin (36:60). The Old Testament tells of the covenant the Jews
made with Allah.

HadIth: (.Ji) (Plural: Ahãdith -) The word HadIth literally means
speech, narration or communication. In Islamic context it refers to any of the
sayings, deeds and approvals accurately narrated from the Prophet Muhammad ij through a chain of known intermediaries. According to some
scholars, the word HadIth also covers reports about the sayings and deeds,
etc., of the Companions of the Prophet J; that were performed in the
presence of the Prophet . There is also a subcategory of oral statements
made by the Companions of the Prophet in addition to the Prophet
himself. Khabar (.J I) (report), 'Athar I) (track, trace, sign, impression,
tradition) and Sunnah (J) (practice, usage, etc) are the terms also to
denote a HadIth.The word Hadith is generally translated as a Narration or
Tradition. The main text of a Hadlth is called Matn(,.i) (main text), which
is preceded by a Sanad (.J) (chain of narrators).
There are two kinds of AhãdIth: AhãdIth NabawI)yah (J -ii) and
AhadIth QudsI)yah. (LJ L-' ) AhädIth are found in various collections
compiled by Muslim scholars in the early centuries of the Muslim civilization.
Six such collections are considered most authentic. Some famous collectors
of AhãdIth are Imãm BukhãrI, Imam Muslim, Imãm Nasã'i, Imam AbU Dãwud, Imam Tirmidhi and Imam Ibn Majah.

ii himself transmitted outside the Noble Qur'an.
HadIth QudsI: i) (Sacred Tradition) A Statement of Allah,

sayings. The meaning of these AhãdIth were revealed to him and he put
them in his own words, unlike the Qur'an that is the Word of Almighty Allah, and the Prophet 4 conveyed it exactly as it was revealed to him. The
scholars of Hadlth say that AhädIth Qudsiyyah are from Allah only as far as
the meaning of the text is concerned and they are from the Prophet of Allah
as to the actual wordings of these messages. It would be erroneous to attribute any of the Qudsi Hadlth to Allah and claim, for example, "Allah said..."
The basic kinds of Ahädith are:
Qawil (JJ ) (Verbal): It records the utterances of the Prophet .
Fi'lI (LJ ) (Practical): It records the deeds of the Prophet .
TaqrIrI ) (Tacit): It records the Prophet's silent approval of some

Allah to prostrate before Adam, and was cast out from heavens. IblIs reasoned to himself that he was superior to Adam since he was made of fire
while Adam was only made of clay. By this one act of defiance, IblIs introduced the sins of pride, envy, and disobedience into the world. Hence, Allah told him that he will dwell in Hell. IblIs asked Allah for a postponement
until the Hereafter. He also asked Allah to allow him to mislead and tempt
humankind to error. This term was granted to him by Allah whereafter he
became the chief promoter of evil and prompted Adam and Eve to disobey
Allah's order. Allah told him that only the misguided ones would follow him
and that He would fill Hell with him and his followers. IblIs swore that he
would mislead and misguide all the people except those sincere and devoted

in order to stay on the Straight Path. He is possessed of a specific personality

salutation, surrender, obedience, loyalty, allegiance and commitment. Literally means 'submission to the will of Allah,' and refers commonly to an
individual's surrender and commitment to God the Creator through adherence to the religion by the same name.The most important and pivotal
concept in Islam is the Oneness of God. See Allah for more on the conept of
God. Islam teaches that all faiths have, in essence, one common message: the
existence of a Supreme Self, the one and only God, whose sovereignty is to
be acknowledged in worship and in the pledge to obey His teachings and
commandments, conveyed through His Messengers and Prophets who were
sent at various times and in many places throughout history. Islam demands
a commitment to submit and surrender to God so that one could live in
peace; peace (Sálãm) is achieved through active obedience to the revealed
commandments of God, for God is the Source of all peace. Commitment to
Islam entails striving for peace through a struggle for justice, equality of opportunity, mutual caring and consideration for others' rights, and continuous
research and acquisition of knowledge for the better protection and utilization of the resources of the universe.
The basic beliefs of Islam are: the Oneness of the only God who is Sovereign
of the universe; the Revelation of the teaching and commandments of God
through angels in heaven to Prophets on earth, and written in sacred writings
that all have the same transcendent source; these contain the will of God
marking the way of peace for the whole universe and all mankind; the Day
of Judgment which inaugurates the Afterlife in which God rewards and punishes with respect to human obedience to His will.
Islam is the last and final religion to all mankind and to all generations irrespective of color, race, nationality, ethnic background, language, or social position. Islam teaches that human diversity is a sign of the richness of God's
mercy, and that God wills human beings to compete with each other in good-
Glossary of Islamic Terms 531 aL4 .tAI
ness in order to test who is the finest in action; this is, according to Islam,
the reason for the creation of the universe.
Islam was revealed to the Prophet (SUrah 3 Al 'Imran—The Family of

5: Al-Mã'idah—The Table Spread, Verse 3) "This day I have perfected your
religion for you,and have chosen for you Islam as your religion."A person
who enters the fold of Islam is called a Muslim. The religion of Islam is not
to be confused with Mohammedanism. The latter is misnomer to Islam. Muslims do not accept this name as it gives wrong information about Islam and
Muslims.

utmost.' It is an Arabic word the root of which is Jahada, which means to
strive for a better way of life. The nouns are Juhd, Mujahid, Jihad, and Ijtihad. The other meanings are: struggle, endeavor, strain, exertion, effort, diligence, fighting to defend one's life, land, and religion. Usually understood
in terms of personal betterment, Jihãd remained a highly nuanced concept,
it should not be confused with Holy War, a common misrepresentation, the
latter does not exist in Islam nor will Islam allow its followers to be involved in a Holy War. The latter refers only to the Holy War of the Crusaders. Jihãd is not a war to force the faith on others, as many people think
of it. It should never be interpreted as a way of compulsion of the belief on
others, since there is an explicit Verse in the Qur'an that says: "There is no
compulsion in religion." (Qur'an: Al-Baqarah 2:256). Jihãd is not a defensive
war only, but a war against any unjust regime, or any evil that is rampant in
the society. If such a regime or a group exists that is spreading misinformation, and by that creating chaos, a war is to be waged against the leaders,
but not against the people to stop it. People should be freed from the un-
Glossary of Islamic Terms 536 ;-ok.V1 .LÔJJ
just regimes and influences so that they can freely choose to believe in Allah and worshiping Him. Not only in peace but also in war, Islam prohibits
terrorism, kidnapping, and hijacking, when carried against civilians. Whoever
commits such violations is considered a murderer in Islam, and is to be
punished by the Islamic state. During defensive wars, Islam prohibits Muslim soldiers from harming civilians, women, children, elderly, and the religious men like priests and rabbis. It also prohibits cutting down trees and
destroying civilian constructions. In short, any cruelty or unjust practice with
the enemies is also prohibited in Islam, in fact Islam introduces the highest
human rights first in the world.

beings that inhabit the world and are required to follow the orders of Allah
and are accountable for their deeds. They can be good or bad, just like people. The word Jinn in Arabic means hidden, which indicates that they are

Muhammad nearly fourteen hundred years ago. It consists of 114 Sürahs
(chapters). It is to be read and recited with rules and regulations. When to
be touched and to be recited, a Muslim is to be in a state of cleanliness and
purity. The authenticity and the totality of the Qur'an have been documented
and recognized. The Qur'än cannot be translated at all as the Qur'n represents the exact Words of Allah. Any translation is considered to be the
explanation to the meaning of the Qur'an. The Qur'an is so rich and comprehensive in matter that it can easily guide men and women in all walks of
their life. It is the ultimate source of guidance for people in all aspects of
their spiritual and material lives. The Qur'an is viewed as the authoritative
guide for human beings, along with the Sunnah of Muhammad . The
Qur'an amends, encompasses, expands, surpasses and abrogates all the earlier revelations revealed to the earlier Prophets. The names and attributes
that are given to the Qur'an in the Qur'an speak for themselves. The Qur'an
is also described to be bounteous, glorious, mighty, honored, exalted, purified, wonderful, blessed, and confirming the truth of previous revelations.
The Qur'an has practically proved the truth and effectiveness of all of its
names and epithets in the life of all true believers, who practiced its teachings sincerely and devoutly. The Qur'an has a universal appeal, regardless of
peoples' color, creed, nationality, and geographical divisions of the world.

thing, e.g., (i) Allah's House Baytul1ah), (ii) Allah's Messenger; (iii) Allah's
slave ('Abdullah); (iv) Allah's spirit (Rühullãh) etc. The rule of the above
words is that the second noun, e.g., House, Messenger, slave, spirit, etc. is
created by Allah and is honorable with Him, similarly Allah's spirit may be
understood as the spirit of Allah, in fact, it is a soul created by Allah, i.e.,
Jesus, and it was His Word: "Be!" - and he was created (like the creation of
Adam). (B) But when one of the two is Allah and the second is neither a
person nor a thing, then it is not a created thing but is a quality of Allah,
e.g., (i) Allah's Knowledge ('Ilmullah); (ii) Allah's Life (Hayatullah); (iii) Allah's Statement (Kalamullah); (iv) Allah's Self (Dhãtullãh) etc.

worship of Allah; TawhIdul-Uluhiyyah: (,it' -) To believe that none
has the right to be worshipped [e.g. praying, invoking, asking for help (from
Glossary of Islamic Terms 590 aL4 JtAJI j4
the unseen), swearing, slaughtering sacrifices, giving charity, fasting, pilgrimage, etc.], but Allah. (C) Oneness of the Names and the Qualities of Allah;
TawhIdul-Asmã' was-Sifat: ( UJ
 , L..I To believe that: (i) we
must not name or qualify Allah except with what He or His Messenger
has named or qualified Him; (ii) none can be named or qualified with the
Names or Qualifications of Allah; e.g. Al-Karim; (iii) we must confirm Allah's
all qualifications which Allah has stated in His Book (the Qur'an) or mentioned through His Messenger (Muhammad ) without changing them or
ignoring them completely or twisting the meanings or giving resemblance to
any of the created things; e.g., Allah is present over His Throne as mentioned in the Qur'an. (V. 20:5): "The Most Beneficent (i.e., Allah) Istawã
(rose over) the (Mighty) Throne" over the seventh heaven; and He only
comes down over the first (nearest) heaven (to us) during the day of 'Arafat
(Hajj, i.e., 9th Dhul-Hijjah) and also during the last third part of the night, as
mentioned by the Prophet , but He is with us by His Knowledge only, not
by His Personal Self (Bi-Dhãtihi), "There is nothing like Him, and He is the
All-Hearer, the All-Seer." (The Qur'an, V. 42:11). This noble Verse confirms
the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for Allah without resemblance
to others; and likewise He also said: "To one whom I have created with Both
My Hands," (V. 38:75); and He also said: "The Hand of Allah is over their
hands.": (V. 48:10). This confirms two Hands for Allah, but there is no similarity for them. This is the Faith of all true believers, and was the Faith of all
the Prophets of Allah from Noah, Abraham, Moses and Christ till the last of
the Prophets, Muhammad . It is not like as some people think that Allah
is present everywhere, here, there and even inside the breasts of men. These
three aspects of TawhId are included in the meanings of La ilaha il/allah
(none has the right to be worshiped but Allah). It is also essential to follow
Allah's Messenger MuhammadJ: Wujübul-Ittiba' and it is a part of
TawhIdul-UluhIyyah. This is included in the meaning: "I testify that MuhammadiJ is the Messenger of Allah" and this means, "None has the right
to be followed after Allah's Book (the Qur'an), but Allah's Messenger ".
